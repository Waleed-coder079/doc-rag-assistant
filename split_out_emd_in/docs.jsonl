However, 836 million people still live in extreme poverty. About one in five persons in developing regions lives on less than $1.25 per day. ● Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are home to the overwhelming majority of people living in extreme poverty. ● High poverty rates are often found in small, fragile and conflict-affected countries. ● One in four children under age five in the world has inadequate height for his or her age. Goal 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture ● Globally, the proportion of undernourished people in the developing regions has fallen by almost half since 1990, from 23.3% in 1990-1992 to 12.9% in 2014-2016. However, one in nine people in the world today (795 million) are still undernourished. ● The vast majority of the world’s hungry people live in developing countries, where 12.9% of the population is undernourished. ● Asia is the continent with the hungriest people – two-thirds of the total. The percentage in southern Asia has fallen in recent years, but in western Asia it has increased slightly. ● Sub-Saharan Africa is the region with the highest prevalence (percentage of population) of hunger. About one person in four there is undernourished. ● Poor nutrition causes nearly half (45%) of deaths in children under five – 3.1 million children each year. ● One in four of the world’s children suffer stunted growth. In developing countries the proportion rises to one in three. ● 66 million primary school-age children in developing countries attend classes hungry, with 23 million in Africa alone. ● Agriculture is the single largest employer in the world, providing livelihoods for 40% of today’s global population. It is the largest source of income and jobs for poor rural households. 1", "strategy": "sentence"}

Breathe out. That act makes you part of Earth’s carbon cycle, like every other living thing on the planet. Carbon, including carbon dioxide, has always cycled into and out of the air from plants and animals, the ocean, and land, with the cycle staying in balance over the long term. Humans are pushing the carbon cycle off balance by fossil fuel burning and deforestation, causing carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere to continue to rise. How is our planet handling this change to one of the key elements of life on Earth? To answer that, we need to keep a close eye on carbon: how and where it is entering and leaving the atmosphere, and how it is interacting with weather and climate. NASA is launching the Orbiting Carbon Observa- tory 3 (OCO-3) in the spring of 2019 to add a new perspective to its carbon observations. OCO-3 will extend the exceptionally accurate OCO-2 data set on atmospheric carbon, which began in July 2014. But the new sensor will be using a different vantage point. Where OCO-2 is in a polar orbit, OCO-3 will be mounted to the International Space Station, which circles Earth from 52 degrees north to 52 degrees south latitudes — about from London to Patagonia. Most of Earth’s living things are found within these limits. The orbit will allow OCO-3 to collect a denser data set than its predecessor over high-carbon re- gions such as the Amazon rainforest. OCO-2 has begun to reveal some of the subtle ways that carbon links everything on Earth, and OCO-3 will increase scientists’ opportunities to gain more insight into still- obscure aspects of the carbon cycle.", "strategy": "sentence"}

As the space station ap- proaches the Southern California coastline, OCO-3 is already starting its third parallel data swath of a total of ﬁve. The complete “snapshot” will provide dense carbon dioxide data over an area of about 250 square miles (650 square kilometers) — the entire Los Angeles metropolitan area. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech Mission Overview OCO-3’s berth on the space station will give scientists the ﬁrst opportunity to observe how carbon dioxide concentrations change throughout the day in many parts of the globe. We know that local carbon dioxide levels rise and fall during the day with changes in emissions and photosynthesis rates, but these changes are measured sparsely worldwide — for example, in large industrialized cities but not the surrounding croplands. The changes can’t be observed globally by a polar-orbiting satellite like OCO-2, which always goes over any given location at the same time of day. The station’s orbit will carry OCO-3 over any location a little earlier on each orbit, spanning all sunlit hours within about a month. OCO-3 will be another step toward monitoring emissions hotspots, volcanic eruptions and other local carbon sources from space. More than 70 percent of carbon dioxide emissions from human activities come from cities, but because the gas mixes rapidly into the atmosphere, urban emissions are challenging to isolate. OCO-3’s “snapshot” mode of observing on a scale of about 50 by 50 miles (80 by 80 kilometers) is a demonstration of how this capability might be improved. Besides carbon dioxide, OCO-3’s high-resolution spectrometers can observe a type of radiation from plants called solar-induced ﬂuorescence (SIF). Plants emit SIF only during photosynthesis, and that is also the only time they absorb carbon dioxide. As the changing climate affects growing seasons worldwide, re- searchers need to understand when photosynthesis is occurring, especially in inaccessible locations like the Arctic. They some- times use space-based observations of vegetation greenness as a stand-in for photosynthesis, but that’s not totally accurate: Evergreen trees, for example, stay green year round but do not absorb carbon dioxide in winter. OCO-3 will allow scientists to explore the value of the SIF measurement for improving under- standing of the carbon cycle in forests and plants. OCO3 2 NASA Facts", "strategy": "sentence"}

OCO-3 will make dense measurements of SIF in the midlatitude and tropics. Credit: NASA/ JPL-Caltech Instrument Overview OCO-3 was built using OCO-2’s spare instrument and the ap- propriate electronics and interfaces to operate on the space sta- tion’s Japanese Experiment Module - Exposed Facility (JEM-EF), an external platform that holds up to 10 instruments. The total cost of building, testing and launching the mission was less than $100 million. The OCO-3 instrument consists of three high-resolution spec- trometers integrated into a common structure and illuminated by a common telescope. One spectrometer measures how much sunlight the oxygen in the atmosphere has absorbed, and the other two measure sunlight absorption by carbon dioxide at two different sets of wavelengths. The ratio of carbon dioxide to oxygen is used to determine the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Currently, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere averages about 405 molecules out of every 1 million molecules of air, a ratio that scientists call “405 parts per million.” OCO-3 will measure this tiny percentage to an accuracy of about 0.3 to 0.5 percent. Obtaining such a precise measurement requires eliminating any sources of instability for the instrument. The external temperature at the space station varies by about 500 degrees Fahrenheit (almost 300 degrees Celsius) between the sunlit and dark parts of each orbit. The extreme temperature swings could affect the measurement. To prevent that, the instrument includes a space “refrigerator” called a cryocooler that will keep the detector near minus 244 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 153 degrees Celsius). Launch and Docking The payload will be launched to the space station with other car- go on Commercial Resupply Services mission 17 no earlier than April 25, 2019. It will ﬂy in the unpressurized portion of a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft — called the trunk — atop a Falcon 9 rocket. It will reach the station about two days after launch.

The reports and cooperation are considered “protected activities” under the policy.1 In order to receive protection, any report should be made as soon as possible, in good faith and not later than six years since you became aware of the original misconduct. To be considered a protected activity, a report of misconduct must include information or evidence to support a reasonable belief that misconduct occurred. Retaliation means any direct or indirect detrimental action that adversely affects your employment or working conditions, where such action has been recommended, threatened or taken for the purpose of punishing, intimidating or injuring you because you engaged in a protected activity. You must submit a request for protection to the Ethics Office within six months of becoming aware of the retaliation. Under the policy, the Ethics Office maintains the confidentiality of all communications received from complainants who request protection. We will not discuss your matter with third parties without receiving your consent first. Seeking protection from the Ethics Office does not preclude you from seeking recourse from other UN offices, when applicable. Retaliation for activities that are not “protected” under this policy (e.g. requesting management evaluation, testifying before a UN administrative tribunal, seeking the assistance of the Ombudsman, disagreeing with management decisions, etc.) may amount to prohibited conduct or misconduct, if proven, and may be protected or remedied under other policies. The Ethics Office’s mandate includes: ETHICS OFFICE ROLE • Receiving retaliation complaints and conducting preliminary reviews; • Referring prima facie cases of retaliation to OIOS for investigation; • Recommending interim protection measures to protect complainants during an investigation; • Referring complainants to the Ombudsman or other informal conflict resolution resources or heads of department/office for managerial problems, as appropriate; and • Recommending final, post-investigation corrective measures when a case of retaliation has been established and recommending referrals for disciplinary action, as appropriate. The Ethics Office does not receive reports of misconduct or wrongdoing; staff members must report to one of the following established internal mechanisms: • • • reporting wrongdoing to Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS), the head of department or office concerned, or the focal point appointed to receive reports of sexual exploitation and abuse. 1 Under very specific and limited conditions, protection against retaliation may be extended to individuals who report misconduct through external mechanisms.", "strategy": "sentence"}

It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. [ 1 ] High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search ); recommendation systems (used by YouTube , Amazon , and Netflix ); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant , Siri , and Alexa ); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo ); generative and creative tools (e.g., language models and AI art ); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go ). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore .\" [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning , knowledge representation , planning , natural language processing , perception , and support for robotics . [ a ] To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization , formal logic , artificial neural networks , and methods based on statistics , operations research , and economics . [ b ] AI also draws upon psychology , linguistics , philosophy , neuroscience , and other fields. [ 4 ] Some companies, such as OpenAI , Google DeepMind and Meta , [ 5 ] aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI)—AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human. Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, [ 6 ] and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history , [ 7 ] [ 8 ] followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. [ 11 ] This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture . [ 12 ] In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom . Generative AI's ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms, which has raised ethical concerns about AI's long-term effects and potential existential risks , prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology. Goals The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research. [ a ] Reasoning and problem-solving Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions . [ 13 ] By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics . [ 14 ] Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow. [ 15 ] Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

Knowledge representation An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts. Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering [ 17 ] allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval, [ 18 ] scene interpretation, [ 19 ] clinical decision support, [ 20 ] knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases ), [ 21 ] and other areas. [ 22 ] A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge. [ 23 ] Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects; [ 24 ] situations, events, states, and time; [ 25 ] causes and effects; [ 26 ] knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know); [ 27 ] default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing); [ 28 ] and many other aspects and domains of knowledge. Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous); [ 29 ] and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally). [ 16 ] There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition , the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications. [ c ] Planning and decision-making An \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen. [ d ] [ 32 ] In automated planning , the agent has a specific goal. [ 33 ] In automated decision-making , the agent has preferences—there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \" utility \") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the \" expected utility \": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility. [ 34 ] In classical planning , the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be. [ 35 ] In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is \"unknown\" or \"unobservable\") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not \"deterministic\"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked. [ 36 ] In some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning ), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences. [ 37 ] Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions. [ 38 ] The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be. A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g., by iteration ), be heuristic , or it can be learned. [ 39 ] Game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents. [ 40 ] Learning Machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically. [ 41 ] It has been a part of AI from the beginning. [ e ] In supervised learning , the training data is labelled with the expected answers, while in unsupervised learning , the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data. There are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance. [ 44 ] Supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input). [ 45 ] In reinforcement learning , the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as \"good\". [ 46 ] Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem. [ 47 ] Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning. [ 48 ] Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity , by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization . [ 49 ] Natural language processing Natural language processing (NLP) allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages. [ 50 ] Specific problems include speech recognition , speech synthesis , machine translation , information extraction , information retrieval and question answering . [ 51 ] Early work, based on Noam Chomsky 's generative grammar and semantic networks , had difficulty with word-sense disambiguation [ f ] unless restricted to small domains called \" micro-worlds \" (due to the common sense knowledge problem [ 29 ] ). Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure. Modern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning), [ 52 ] transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism), [ 53 ] and others. [ 54 ] In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or \"GPT\") language models began to generate coherent text, [ 55 ] [ 56 ] and by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam , SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications. [ 57 ] Perception Machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar , sonar, radar, and tactile sensors ) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input. [ 58 ] The field includes speech recognition , [ 59 ] image classification , [ 60 ] facial recognition , object recognition , [ 61 ] object tracking , [ 62 ] and robotic perception . [ 63 ] Social intelligence Kismet , a robot head which was made in the 1990s; it is a machine that can recognize and simulate emotions. [ 64 ] Affective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human feeling, emotion, and mood . [ 65 ] For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction . However, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents. [ 66 ] Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis , wherein AI classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject. [ 67 ] General intelligence A machine with artificial general intelligence would be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence .

[ b ] Search and optimization AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions. [ 69 ] There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search . State space search State space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state. [ 70 ] For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis . [ 71 ] Simple exhaustive searches [ 72 ] are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers . The result is a search that is too slow or never completes. [ 15 ] \" Heuristics \" or \"rules of thumb\" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal. [ 73 ] Adversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves, looking for a winning position. [ 74 ] Local search Illustration of gradient descent for 3 different starting points; two parameters (represented by the plan coordinates) are adjusted in order to minimize the loss function (the height) Local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally. [ 75 ] Gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function . Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks , [ 76 ] through the backpropagation algorithm. Another type of local search is evolutionary computation , which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by \"mutating\" and \"recombining\" them, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation. [ 77 ] Distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking ) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails ). [ 78 ] Logic Formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation . ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 81 ] Deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement ( conclusion ) from other statements that are given and assumed to be true (the premises ). [ 82 ] Proofs can be structured as proof trees , in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules . Given a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms . In the case of Horn clauses , problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem. [ 83 ] In the more general case of the clausal form of first-order logic , resolution is a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved. [ 84 ] Inference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is undecidable , and therefore intractable . However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the logic programming language Prolog , is Turing complete . Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages. [ 85 ] Fuzzy logic assigns a \"degree of truth\" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true. [ 86 ] Non-monotonic logics , including logic programming with negation as failure , are designed to handle default reasoning . [ 28 ] Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains. Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning A simple Bayesian network , with the associated conditional probability tables Many problems in AI (including reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics. [ 87 ] Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory , decision analysis , [ 88 ] and information value theory . [ 89 ] These tools include models such as Markov decision processes , [ 90 ] dynamic decision networks , [ 91 ] game theory and mechanism design . [ 92 ] Bayesian networks [ 93 ] are a tool that can be used for reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm), [ g ] [ 95 ] learning (using the expectation–maximization algorithm ), [ h ] [ 97 ] planning (using decision networks ) [ 98 ] and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks ). [ 91 ] Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data, thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters ). [ 91 ] Expectation–maximization clustering of Old Faithful eruption data starts from a random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption. Classifiers and statistical learning methods The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g., \"if shiny then diamond\"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g., \"if diamond then pick up\"), on the other hand.

They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning . Each pattern (also called an \" observation \") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set . When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience. [ 45 ] There are many kinds of classifiers in use. [ 100 ] The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm. [ 101 ] K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s. [ 102 ] The naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\" [ 103 ] at Google, due in part to its scalability. [ 104 ] Neural networks are also used as classifiers. [ 105 ] Artificial neural networks A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain . An artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons , which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers. [ 105 ] Learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm. [ 106 ] Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function. [ 107 ] In feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction. [ 108 ] The term perceptron typically refers to a single-layer neural network. [ 109 ] In contrast, deep learning uses many layers. [ 110 ] Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events. Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) are recurrent neural networks that better preserve longterm dependencies and are less sensitive to the vanishing gradient problem . [ 111 ] Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use layers of kernels to more efficiently process local patterns. This local processing is especially important in image processing , where the early CNN layers typically identify simple local patterns such as edges and curves, with subsequent layers detecting more complex patterns like textures, and eventually whole objects. [ 112 ] Deep learning Deep learning is a subset of machine learning , which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence. [ 113 ] Deep learning uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs. [ 110 ] The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing , lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces. [ 114 ] Deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision , speech recognition , natural language processing , image classification , [ 115 ] and others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2021. [ 116 ] The sudden success of deep learning in 2012–2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s) [ i ] but because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs ) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet . [ j ] GPT Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models (LLMs) that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences. Text-based GPT models are pre-trained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called \" hallucinations \". These can be reduced with RLHF and quality data, but the problem has been getting worse for reasoning systems. [ 124 ] Such systems are used in chatbots , which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text. [ 125 ] [ 126 ] Current models and services include ChatGPT , Claude , Gemini , Copilot , and Meta AI . [ 127 ] Multimodal GPT models can process different types of data ( modalities ) such as images, videos, sound, and text. [ 128 ] Hardware and software Main articles: Programming languages for artificial intelligence and Hardware for artificial intelligence In the late 2010s, graphics processing units (GPUs) that were increasingly designed with AI-specific enhancements and used with specialized TensorFlow software had replaced previously used central processing unit (CPUs) as the dominant means for large-scale (commercial and academic) machine learning models' training.

Improvements in GPUs have been even faster, [ 132 ] a trend sometimes called Huang's law , [ 133 ] named after Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang . Applications Main article: Applications of artificial intelligence AI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including: search engines (such as Google Search ), targeting online advertisements , recommendation systems (offered by Netflix , YouTube or Amazon ), driving internet traffic , targeted advertising ( AdSense , Facebook ), virtual assistants (such as Siri or Alexa ), autonomous vehicles (including drones , ADAS and self-driving cars ), automatic language translation ( Microsoft Translator , Google Translate ), facial recognition ( Apple 's FaceID or Microsoft 's DeepFace and Google 's FaceNet ) and image labeling (used by Facebook , Apple's Photos and TikTok ). The deployment of AI may be overseen by a chief automation officer (CAO). Health and medicine Main article: Artificial intelligence in healthcare The application of AI in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life. [ 134 ] Through the lens of the Hippocratic Oath , medical professionals are ethically compelled to use AI, if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients. [ 135 ] [ 136 ] For medical research, AI is an important tool for processing and integrating big data . This is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication. [ 137 ] It has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research. [ 137 ] [ 138 ] New AI tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways. For example, AlphaFold 2 (2021) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein . [ 139 ] In 2023, it was reported that AI-guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria. [ 140 ] In 2024, researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for Parkinson's disease drug treatments. Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping, or aggregation, of alpha-synuclein (the protein that characterises Parkinson's disease). They were able to speed up the initial screening process ten-fold and reduce the cost by a thousand-fold. [ 141 ] [ 142 ] Games Main article: Artificial intelligence in video games Game playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI's most advanced techniques. [ 143 ] Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov , on 11 May 1997. [ 144 ] In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM 's question answering system , Watson , defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings , by a significant margin. [ 145 ] In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol , becoming the first computer Go -playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps . Then, in 2017, it defeated Ke Jie , who was the best Go player in the world. [ 146 ] Other programs handle imperfect-information games, such as the poker -playing program Pluribus . [ 147 ] DeepMind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models, such as with MuZero , which could be trained to play chess, Go, or Atari games. [ 148 ] In 2019, DeepMind's AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II , a particularly challenging real-time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map. [ 149 ] In 2021, an AI agent competed in a PlayStation Gran Turismo competition, winning against four of the world's best Gran Turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning. [ 150 ] In 2024, Google DeepMind introduced SIMA, a type of AI capable of autonomously playing nine previously unseen open-world video games by observing screen output, as well as executing short, specific tasks in response to natural language instructions.

They sometimes need a large database of mathematical problems to learn from, but also methods such as supervised fine-tuning [ 152 ] or trained classifiers with human-annotated data to improve answers for new problems and learn from corrections. [ 153 ] A February 2024 study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low, even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data. [ 154 ] One technique to improve their performance involves training the models to produce correct reasoning steps, rather than just the correct result. [ 155 ] The Alibaba Group developed a version of its Qwen models called Qwen2-Math , that achieved state-of-the-art performance on several mathematical benchmarks, including 84% accuracy on the MATH dataset of competition mathematics problems. [ 156 ] In January 2025, Microsoft proposed the technique rStar-Math that leverages Monte Carlo tree search and step-by-step reasoning, enabling a relatively small language model like Qwen-7B to solve 53% of the AIME 2024 and 90% of the MATH benchmark problems.

[ 161 ] When natural language is used to describe mathematical problems, converters can transform such prompts into a formal language such as Lean to define mathematical tasks. The experimental model Gemini Deep Think accepts natural language prompts directly and achieved gold medal results in the International Math Olympiad of 2025. [ 162 ] Some models have been developed to solve challenging problems and reach good results in benchmark tests, others to serve as educational tools in mathematics. [ 163 ] Topological deep learning integrates various topological approaches. Finance Finance is one of the fastest growing sectors where applied AI tools are being deployed: from retail online banking to investment advice and insurance, where automated \"robot advisers\" have been in use for some years. [ 164 ] According to Nicolas Firzli, director of the World Pensions & Investments Forum , it may be too early to see the emergence of highly innovative AI-informed financial products and services. He argues that \"the deployment of AI tools will simply further automatise things: destroying tens of thousands of jobs in banking, financial planning, and pension advice in the process, but I'm not sure it will unleash a new wave of [e.g., sophisticated] pension innovation.\" [ 165 ] Military Main article: Military applications of artificial intelligence Various countries are deploying AI military applications. [ 166 ] The main applications enhance command and control , communications, sensors, integration and interoperability. [ 167 ] Research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles . [ 166 ] AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition , coordination and deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires between networked combat vehicles, both human-operated and autonomous . [ 167 ] AI has been used in military operations in Iraq, Syria, Israel and Ukraine.

[ edit ] Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI, GenAI, [ 171 ] or GAI) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to produce text, images, videos, or other forms of data. [ 172 ] [ 173 ] [ 174 ] These models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data and use them to produce new data [ 175 ] [ 176 ] based on the input, which often comes in the form of natural language prompts . [ 177 ] [ 178 ] Generative AI tools have become more common since the AI boom in the 2020s. This boom was made possible by improvements in transformer -based deep neural networks , particularly large language models (LLMs). Major tools include chatbots such as ChatGPT , Copilot , Gemini , Claude , Grok , and DeepSeek ; text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion , Midjourney , and DALL-E ; and text-to-video models such as Veo and Sora . [ 179 ] [ 180 ] [ 181 ] [ 182 ] [ 183 ] Technology companies developing generative AI include OpenAI , xAI , Anthropic , Meta AI , Microsoft , Google , DeepSeek , and Baidu . [ 177 ] [ 184 ] [ 185 ] Generative AI is used across many industries, including software development, [ 186 ] healthcare, [ 187 ] finance, [ 188 ] entertainment, [ 189 ] customer service, [ 190 ] sales and marketing, [ 191 ] art, writing, [ 192 ] fashion, [ 193 ] and product design. [ 194 ] The production of generative AI systems requires large scale data centers using specialized chips which require a lot of electricity for processing and water for cooling. [ 195 ] Agents Main article: Agentic AI AI agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents. AI agents are used in various applications, including virtual assistants , chatbots , autonomous vehicles , game-playing systems , and industrial robotics . AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities. In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution. Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training. Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks. [ 196 ] [ 197 ] [ 198 ] Web search Microsoft introduced Copilot Search in February 2023 under the name Bing Chat , as a built-in feature for Microsoft Edge and Bing mobile app. Copilot Search provides AI-generated summaries [ 199 ] and step-by-step reasoning based of information from web publishers, ranked in Bing Search. [ 200 ] For safety, Copilot uses AI-based classifiers and filters to reduce potentially harmful content. [ 201 ] Google officially pushed its AI Search at its Google I/O event on May 20, 2025. [ 202 ] It keeps people looking at Google instead of clicking on a search result. AI Overviews uses Gemini 2.5 to provide contextual answers to user queries based on web content. [ 203 ] Sexuality Applications of AI in this domain include AI-enabled menstruation and fertility trackers that analyze user data to offer predictions, [ 204 ] AI-integrated sex toys (e.g., teledildonics ), [ 205 ] AI-generated sexual education content, [ 206 ] and AI agents that simulate sexual and romantic partners (e.g., Replika ). [ 207 ] AI is also used for the production of non-consensual deepfake pornography , raising significant ethical and legal concerns. [ 208 ] AI technologies have also been used to attempt to identify online gender-based violence and online sexual grooming of minors. [ 209 ] [ 210 ] Other industry-specific tasks There are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported having incorporated \"AI\" in some offerings or processes. [ 211 ] A few examples are energy storage , medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions, foreign policy , or supply chain management. AI applications for evacuation and disaster management are growing. AI has been used to investigate patterns in large-scale and small-scale evacuations using historical data from GPS, videos or social media. Furthermore, AI can provide real-time information on the evacuation conditions. [ 212 ] [ 213 ] [ 214 ] In agriculture, AI has helped farmers to increase yield and identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments. Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct predictive analytics , classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water. Artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for \"classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights.\" For example, it is used for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy.

During the 2024 Indian elections , US$50 million was spent on authorized AI-generated content, notably by creating deepfakes of allied (including sometimes deceased) politicians to better engage with voters, and by translating speeches to various local languages. [ 215 ] Ethics Main article: Ethics of artificial intelligence Street art in Tel Aviv [ 216 ] [ 217 ] AI has potential benefits and potential risks. [ 218 ] AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: Demis Hassabis of DeepMind hopes to \"solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else\". [ 219 ] However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified. [ 220 ] [ 221 ] In-production systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their AI training processes, especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning. [ 222 ] Risks and harm Privacy and copyright Further information: Information privacy and Artificial intelligence and copyright Machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy , surveillance and copyright . AI-powered devices and services, such as virtual assistants and IoT products, continuously collect personal information, raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties. The loss of privacy is further exacerbated by AI's ability to process and combine vast amounts of data, potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency. Sensitive user data collected may include online activity records, geolocation data, video, or audio. [ 223 ] For example, in order to build speech recognition algorithms, Amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them. [ 224 ] Opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy . [ 225 ] AI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such as data aggregation , de-identification and differential privacy . [ 226 ] Since 2016, some privacy experts, such as Cynthia Dwork , have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness . Brian Christian wrote that experts have pivoted \"from the question of 'what they know' to the question of 'what they're doing with it'.\" [ 227 ] Generative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under the rationale of \" fair use \". Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include \"the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work\" and \"the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work\". [ 228 ] [ 229 ] Website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a \" robots.txt \" file. [ 230 ] In 2023, leading authors (including John Grisham and Jonathan Franzen ) sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI. [ 231 ] [ 232 ] Another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by AI to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors.

[ 237 ] [ 238 ] Power needs and environmental impacts See also: Environmental impacts of artificial intelligence In January 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released Electricity 2024, Analysis and Forecast to 2026 , forecasting electric power use. [ 239 ] This is the first IEA report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. The report states that power demand for these uses might double by 2026, with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole Japanese nation. [ 240 ] Prodigious power consumption by AI is responsible for the growth of fossil fuel use, and might delay closings of obsolete, carbon-emitting coal energy facilities. There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US, making large technology firms (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon) into voracious consumers of electric power. Projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search. The large firms are in haste to find power sources – from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. The tech firms argue that – in the long view – AI will be eventually kinder to the environment, but they need the energy now. AI makes the power grid more efficient and \"intelligent\", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to technology firms. [ 241 ] A 2024 Goldman Sachs Research Paper, AI Data Centers and the Coming US Power Demand Surge , found \"US power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation....\" and forecasts that, by 2030, US data centers will consume 8% of US power, as opposed to 3% in 2022, presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means. [ 242 ] Data centers' need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid. The Big Tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all. [ 243 ] In 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that big AI companies have begun negotiations with the US nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers. In March 2024 Amazon purchased a Pennsylvania nuclear-powered data center for US$650 million. [ 244 ] Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers. [ 245 ] In September 2024, Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation Energy to re-open the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100% of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years. Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission . If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power – enough for 800,000 homes – of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at US$1.6 billion and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act . [ 246 ] The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost US$2 billion to reopen the Palisades Nuclear reactor on Lake Michigan. Closed since 2022, the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO of Exelon who was responsible for Exelon's spinoff of Constellation.

[ 248 ] Although most nuclear plants in Japan have been shut down after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident , according to an October 2024 Bloomberg article in Japanese, cloud gaming services company Ubitus, in which Nvidia has a stake, is looking for land in Japan near a nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative AI. [ 249 ] Ubitus CEO Wesley Kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient, cheap and stable power for AI. [ 249 ] On 1 November 2024, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected an application submitted by Talen Energy for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station Susquehanna to Amazon's data center. [ 250 ] According to the Commission Chairman Willie L. Phillips , it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors. [ 250 ] In 2025, a report prepared by the International Energy Agency estimated the greenhouse gas emissions from the energy consumption of AI at 180 million tons. By 2035, these emissions could rise to 300–500 million tonnes depending on what measures will be taken. This is below 1.5% of the energy sector emissions. The emissions reduction potential of AI was estimated at 5% of the energy sector emissions, but rebound effects (for example if people switch from public transport to autonomous cars) can reduce it.

[ 264 ] The developers may not be aware that the bias exists. [ 265 ] Bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed. [ 266 ] [ 264 ] If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people (as it can in medicine , finance , recruitment , housing or policing ) then the algorithm may cause discrimination . [ 267 ] The field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases. On June 28, 2015, Google Photos 's new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as \"gorillas\" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people, [ 268 ] a problem called \"sample size disparity\". [ 269 ] Google \"fixed\" this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a \"gorilla\". Eight years later, in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon.

In 2016, Julia Angwin at ProPublica discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different—the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend. [ 271 ] In 2017, several researchers [ l ] showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data. [ 273 ] A program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as \"race\" or \"gender\"). The feature will correlate with other features (like \"address\", \"shopping history\" or \"first name\"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on \"race\" or \"gender\". [ 274 ] Moritz Hardt said \"the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn't work.\" [ 275 ] Criticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make \"predictions\" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions as recommendations , some of these \"recommendations\" will likely be racist. [ 276 ] Thus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

One broad category is distributive fairness , which focuses on the outcomes, often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities. Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative stereotypes or render certain groups invisible. Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases, but it may conflict with anti-discrimination laws . [ 263 ] At its 2022 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT 2022), the Association for Computing Machinery , in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings that recommend that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe, and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed. [ dubious – discuss ] [ 278 ] Lack of transparency See also: Explainable AI , Algorithmic transparency , and Right to explanation Many AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions. [ 279 ] Particularly with deep neural networks , in which there are many non- linear relationships between inputs and outputs. But some popular explainability techniques exist. [ 280 ] It is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works. There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as \"cancerous\", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale. [ 281 ] Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at \"low risk\" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading. [ 282 ] People who have been harmed by an algorithm's decision have a right to an explanation.

SHAP enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output. [ 286 ] LIME can locally approximate a model's outputs with a simpler, interpretable model. [ 287 ] Multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned.

A lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human supervision.

[ 292 ] Even when used in conventional warfare, they currently cannot reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person . [ 292 ] In 2014, 30 nations (including China) supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the United Nations ' Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons , however the United States and others disagreed. [ 293 ] By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots. [ 294 ] AI tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways. Face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance . Machine learning , operating this data, can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding.

[ 298 ] Technological unemployment Main articles: Workplace impact of artificial intelligence and Technological unemployment Economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment. [ 299 ] In the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that \"we're in uncharted territory\" with AI. [ 300 ] A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment , but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed . [ 301 ] Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimated 47% of U.S. jobs are at \"high risk\" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9% of U.S. jobs as \"high risk\". [ p ] [ 303 ] The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies. [ 299 ] In April 2023, it was reported that 70% of the jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence. [ 304 ] [ 305 ] Unlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist stated in 2015 that \"the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution\" is \"worth taking seriously\". [ 306 ] Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy. [ 307 ] From the early days of the development of artificial intelligence, there have been arguments, for example, those put forward by Joseph Weizenbaum , about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement. [ 308 ] Existential risk Main article: Existential risk from artificial intelligence It has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as physicist Stephen Hawking stated, \" spell the end of the human race \". [ 309 ] This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like \"self-awareness\" (or \"sentience\" or \"consciousness\") and becomes a malevolent character. [ q ] These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways. First, AI does not require human-like sentience to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of a paperclip maximizer ). [ 311 ] Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that \"you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead.\" [ 312 ] In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity's morality and values so that it is \"fundamentally on our side\". [ 313 ] Second, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like ideologies , law , government , money and the economy are built on language ; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive. [ 314 ] The opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI. [ 315 ] Personalities such as Stephen Hawking , Bill Gates , and Elon Musk , [ 316 ] as well as AI pioneers such as Yoshua Bengio , Stuart Russell , Demis Hassabis , and Sam Altman , have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI. In May 2023, Geoffrey Hinton announced his resignation from Google in order to be able to \"freely speak out about the risks of AI\" without \"considering how this impacts Google\". [ 317 ] He notably mentioned risks of an AI takeover , [ 318 ] and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes, establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI. [ 319 ] In 2023, many leading AI experts endorsed the joint statement that \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\". [ 320 ] Some other researchers were more optimistic. AI pioneer Jürgen Schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95% of all cases, AI research is about making \"human lives longer and healthier and easier.\" [ 321 ] While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, \"they can also be used against the bad actors.\" [ 322 ] [ 323 ] Andrew Ng also argued that \"it's a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI—and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests.\" [ 324 ] Yann LeCun \"scoffs at his peers' dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction.\" [ 325 ] In the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine.

[ 327 ] Ethical machines and alignment Main articles: Machine ethics , AI safety , Friendly artificial intelligence , Artificial moral agents , and Human Compatible Friendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. Eliezer Yudkowsky , who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk. [ 328 ] Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas. [ 329 ] The field of machine ethics is also called computational morality, [ 329 ] and was founded at an AAAI symposium in 2005. [ 330 ] Other approaches include Wendell Wallach 's \"artificial moral agents\" [ 331 ] and Stuart J. Russell 's three principles for developing provably beneficial machines. [ 332 ] Open source See also: Lists of open-source artificial intelligence software Active organizations in the AI open-source community include Hugging Face , [ 333 ] Google , [ 334 ] EleutherAI and Meta . [ 335 ] Various AI models, such as Llama 2 , Mistral or Stable Diffusion , have been made open-weight, [ 336 ] [ 337 ] meaning that their architecture and trained parameters (the \"weights\") are publicly available. Open-weight models can be freely fine-tuned , which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case. [ 338 ] Open-weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused. Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as objecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities (such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism ) and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed. They recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses. [ 339 ] Frameworks Artificial intelligence projects can be guided by ethical considerations during the design, development, and implementation of an AI system. An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework, developed by the Alan Turing Institute and based on the SUM values, outlines four main ethical dimensions, defined as follows: [ 340 ] [ 341 ] Respect the dignity of individual people Connect with other people sincerely, openly, and inclusively Care for the wellbeing of everyone Protect social values, justice, and the public interest Other developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the Asilomar Conference , the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, and the IEEE's Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative, among others; [ 342 ] however, these principles are not without criticism, especially regarding the people chosen to contribute to these frameworks. [ 343 ] Promotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of AI system design, development and implementation, and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists, product managers, data engineers, domain experts, and delivery managers. [ 344 ] The UK AI Safety Institute released in 2024 a testing toolset called 'Inspect' for AI safety evaluations available under an MIT open-source licence which is freely available on GitHub and can be improved with third-party packages. It can be used to evaluate AI models in a range of areas including core knowledge, ability to reason, and autonomous capabilities. [ 345 ] Regulation Main articles: Regulation of artificial intelligence , Regulation of algorithms , and AI safety The first global AI Safety Summit was held in the United Kingdom in November 2023 with a declaration calling for international cooperation. The regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI; it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms. [ 346 ] The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally. [ 347 ] According to AI Index at Stanford , the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone. [ 348 ] [ 349 ] Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI. [ 350 ] Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, U.S., and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia. [ 350 ] The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology. [ 350 ] Henry Kissinger , Eric Schmidt , and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI. [ 351 ] In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years. [ 352 ] In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, government officials and academics. [ 353 ] On 1 August 2024, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act entered into force, establishing the first comprehensive EU-wide AI regulation. [ 354 ] In 2024, the Council of Europe created the first international legally binding treaty on AI, called the \" Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law \". It was adopted by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other signatories. [ 355 ] In a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only 35% of Americans, agreed that \"products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks\". [ 348 ] A 2023 Reuters /Ipsos poll found that 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity. [ 356 ] In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35% of Americans thought it \"very important\", and an additional 41% thought it \"somewhat important\", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13% responding \"not very important\" and 8% responding \"not at all important\". [ 357 ] [ 358 ] In November 2023, the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks. [ 359 ] 28 countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of the summit, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence. [ 360 ] [ 361 ] In May 2024 at the AI Seoul Summit , 16 global AI tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of AI. [ 362 ] [ 363 ] History Main article: History of artificial intelligence For a chronological guide, see Timeline of artificial intelligence . In 2024, AI patents in China and the US numbered more than three-fourths of AI patents worldwide. [ 364 ] Though China had more AI patents, the US had 35% more patents per AI patent-applicant company than China. [ 364 ] The study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing 's theory of computation , which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning. [ 365 ] [ 366 ] This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics , information theory and neurobiology , led researchers to consider the possibility of building an \"electronic brain\". [ r ] They developed several areas of research that would become part of AI, [ 368 ] such as McCulloch and Pitts design for \"artificial neurons\" in 1943, [ 117 ] and Turing's influential 1950 paper ' Computing Machinery and Intelligence ', which introduced the Turing test and showed that \"machine intelligence\" was plausible. [ 369 ] [ 366 ] The field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956. [ s ] [ 6 ] The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s. [ t ] They and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\": [ u ] computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English. [ v ] [ 7 ] Artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and U.S. universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s. [ 366 ] Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field. [ 373 ] In 1965 Herbert Simon predicted, \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\". [ 374 ] In 1967 Marvin Minsky agreed, writing that \"within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved\". [ 375 ] They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 378 ] Minsky and Papert 's book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether. [ 379 ] The \" AI winter \", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed. [ 9 ] In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems , [ 380 ] a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research . [ 8 ] However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began. [ 10 ] Up to this point, most of AI's funding had gone to projects that used high-level symbols to represent mental objects like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception , robotics , learning and pattern recognition , [ 381 ] and began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches. [ 382 ] Rodney Brooks rejected \"representation\" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive. [ x ] Judea Pearl , Lotfi Zadeh , and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic. [ 87 ] [ 387 ] But the most important development was the revival of \" connectionism \", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others. [ 388 ] In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks. [ 389 ] AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems.

Deep learning's success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI.

[ 397 ] It marked what is widely regarded as AI's breakout year, bringing it into the public consciousness. [ 398 ] These programs, and others, inspired an aggressive AI boom , where large companies began investing billions of dollars in AI research. According to AI Impacts, about US$50 billion annually was invested in \"AI\" around 2022 in the U.S. alone and about 20% of the new U.S. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in \"AI\". [ 399 ] About 800,000 \"AI\"-related U.S. job openings existed in 2022. [ 400 ] According to PitchBook research, 22% of newly funded startups in 2024 claimed to be AI companies. [ 401 ] Philosophy Main article: Philosophy of artificial intelligence Philosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines. [ 402 ] Another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious, and the associated ethical implications. [ 403 ] Many other topics in philosophy are relevant to AI, such as epistemology and free will . [ 404 ] Rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of AI . [ 403 ] Defining artificial intelligence See also: Synthetic intelligence , Intelligent agent , Artificial mind , Virtual intelligence , and Dartmouth workshop Alan Turing wrote in 1950 \"I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?\" [ 405 ] He advised changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\". [ 405 ] He devised the Turing test , which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation. [ 369 ] Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\". Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks.\" [ 406 ] The Turing test can provide some evidence of intelligence, but it penalizes non-human intelligent behavior. [ 407 ] Russell and Norvig agree with Turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior, not internal structure. [ 1 ] However, they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans. \" Aeronautical engineering texts\", they wrote, \"do not define the goal of their field as making 'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons. ' \" [ 408 ] AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\". [ 409 ] McCarthy defines intelligence as \"the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world\". [ 410 ] Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky , similarly describes it as \"the ability to solve hard problems\". [ 411 ] The leading AI textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. [ 1 ] These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the \"intelligence\" of the machine—and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible. Another definition has been adopted by Google, [ 412 ] a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence. As a result of the many circulating definitions scholars have started to critically analyze and order the AI discourse itself [ 413 ] including discussing the many AI narratives and myths to be found within societal, political and academic discourses. [ 414 ] Similarly, in practice, some authors have suggested that the term 'AI' is often used too broadly and vaguely. This raises the question of where the line should be drawn between AI and classical algorithms, [ 415 ] with many companies during the early 2020s AI boom using the term as a marketing buzzword , often even if they did \"not actually use AI in a material way\". [ 416 ] There has been debate over whether large language models exhibit genuine intelligence or merely simulate it by imitating human text . [ 417 ] Evaluating approaches to AI No established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history. [ aa ] The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\"). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic , soft and narrow . ", "strategy": "semantic"}

Symbolic AI and its limits Symbolic AI (or \" GOFAI \") [ 419 ] simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis : \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\" [ 420 ] However, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning . Moravec's paradox is the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for AI, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult. [ 421 ] Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge. [ 422 ] Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him. [ ab ] [ 16 ] The issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias . Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence, [ 424 ] [ 425 ] in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI : it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches. Neat vs. scruffy Main article: Neats and scruffies \"Neats\" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic , optimization , or neural networks ). \"Scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s, [ 426 ] but eventually was seen as irrelevant. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

Soft vs. hard computing Main article: Soft computing Finding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems. [ 15 ] Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms , fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks. Narrow vs. general AI Main articles: Weak artificial intelligence and Artificial general intelligence AI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field's long-term goals. [ 427 ] [ 428 ] General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively. Machine consciousness, sentience, and mind Main articles: Philosophy of artificial intelligence and Artificial consciousness There is no settled consensus in philosophy of mind on whether a machine can have a mind , consciousness and mental states in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. Russell and Norvig add that \"[t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on.\" [ 429 ] However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind.

The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett's consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). While human information processing is easy to explain, human subjective experience is difficult to explain. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 431 ] Computationalism and functionalism Main articles: Computational theory of mind and Functionalism (philosophy of mind) Computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind–body problem . This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam . [ 432 ] Philosopher John Searle characterized this position as \" strong AI \": \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\" [ ac ] Searle challenges this claim with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind. [ 436 ] AI welfare and rights It is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient (has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree. [ 437 ] But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals. [ 438 ] [ 439 ] Sapience (a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment or self-awareness ) may provide another moral basis for AI rights. [ 438 ] Robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society. [ 440 ] In 2017, the European Union considered granting \"electronic personhood\" to some of the most capable AI systems. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities. [ 441 ] Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of human rights , and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios. They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part in society on their own. [ 442 ] [ 443 ] Progress in AI increased interest in the topic. Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny. They warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming , which could lead to large-scale suffering if sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited. [ 439 ] [ 438 ] Future Superintelligence and the singularity A superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind. [ 428 ] If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself . The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I. J. Good called an \" intelligence explosion \" and Vernor Vinge called a \" singularity \". [ 444 ] However, technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely, and typically follow an S-shaped curve , slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do. [ 445 ] Transhumanism Main article: Transhumanism Robot designer Hans Moravec , cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger . [ 446 ] Edward Fredkin argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution\", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler 's \" Darwin among the Machines \" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his 1998 book Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence . [ 447 ] In fiction Main article: Artificial intelligence in fiction The word \"robot\" itself was coined by Karel Čapek in his 1921 play R.U.R. , the title standing for \"Rossum's Universal Robots\". Thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity, [ 448 ] and have been a persistent theme in science fiction . [ 449 ] A common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein , where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke's and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000 , the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture. [ 450 ] Isaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many stories, most notably with the \" Multivac \" super-intelligent computer. Asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics; [ 451 ] while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity. [ 452 ] Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel , and thus to suffer. This appears in Karel Čapek 's R.U.R. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. [ 1 ] High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search ); recommendation systems (used by YouTube , Amazon , and Netflix ); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant , Siri , and Alexa ); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo ); generative and creative tools (e.g., language models and AI art ); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go ). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore .\" [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning , knowledge representation , planning , natural language processing , perception , and support for robotics . [ a ] To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization , formal logic , artificial neural networks , and methods based on statistics , operations research , and economics . [ b ] AI also draws upon psychology , linguistics , philosophy , neuroscience , and other fields. [ 4 ] Some companies, such as OpenAI , Google DeepMind and Meta , [ 5 ] aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI)—AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human. Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, [ 6 ] and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history , [ 7 ] [ 8 ] followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. [ 11 ] This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture . [ 12 ] In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom . Generative AI's ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms, which has raised ethical concerns about AI's long-term effects and potential existential risks , prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology. Goals The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research. [ a ] Reasoning and problem-solving Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions . [ 13 ] By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics . [ 14 ] Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow. [ 15 ] Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

Knowledge representation An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts. Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering [ 17 ] allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval, [ 18 ] scene interpretation, [ 19 ] clinical decision support, [ 20 ] knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases ), [ 21 ] and other areas. [ 22 ] A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge. [ 23 ] Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects; [ 24 ] situations, events, states, and time; [ 25 ] causes and effects; [ 26 ] knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know); [ 27 ] default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing); [ 28 ] and many other aspects and domains of knowledge. Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous); [ 29 ] and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally). [ 16 ] There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition , the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications. [ c ] Planning and decision-making An \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen. [ d ] [ 32 ] In automated planning , the agent has a specific goal. [ 33 ] In automated decision-making , the agent has preferences—there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \" utility \") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the \" expected utility \": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility. [ 34 ] In classical planning , the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be. [ 35 ] In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is \"unknown\" or \"unobservable\") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not \"deterministic\"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked. [ 36 ] In some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning ), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences. [ 37 ] Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions. [ 38 ] The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be. A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g., by iteration ), be heuristic , or it can be learned. [ 39 ] Game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents. [ 40 ] Learning Machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically. [ 41 ] It has been a part of AI from the beginning. [ e ] In supervised learning , the training data is labelled with the expected answers, while in unsupervised learning , the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data. There are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance. [ 44 ] Supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input). [ 45 ] In reinforcement learning , the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as \"good\". [ 46 ] Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem. [ 47 ] Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning. [ 48 ] Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity , by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization . [ 49 ] Natural language processing Natural language processing (NLP) allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages. [ 50 ] Specific problems include speech recognition , speech synthesis , machine translation , information extraction , information retrieval and question answering . [ 51 ] Early work, based on Noam Chomsky 's generative grammar and semantic networks , had difficulty with word-sense disambiguation [ f ] unless restricted to small domains called \" micro-worlds \" (due to the common sense knowledge problem [ 29 ] ). Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure. Modern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning), [ 52 ] transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism), [ 53 ] and others. [ 54 ] In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or \"GPT\") language models began to generate coherent text, [ 55 ] [ 56 ] and by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam , SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications. [ 57 ] Perception Machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar , sonar, radar, and tactile sensors ) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input. [ 58 ] The field includes speech recognition , [ 59 ] image classification , [ 60 ] facial recognition , object recognition , [ 61 ] object tracking , [ 62 ] and robotic perception . [ 63 ] Social intelligence Kismet , a robot head which was made in the 1990s; it is a machine that can recognize and simulate emotions. [ 64 ] Affective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human feeling, emotion, and mood . [ 65 ] For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction . However, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents. [ 66 ] Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis , wherein AI classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject. [ 67 ] General intelligence A machine with artificial general intelligence would be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence .

[ b ] Search and optimization AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions. [ 69 ] There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search . State space search State space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state. [ 70 ] For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis . [ 71 ] Simple exhaustive searches [ 72 ] are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers . The result is a search that is too slow or never completes. [ 15 ] \" Heuristics \" or \"rules of thumb\" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal. [ 73 ] Adversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves, looking for a winning position. [ 74 ] Local search Illustration of gradient descent for 3 different starting points; two parameters (represented by the plan coordinates) are adjusted in order to minimize the loss function (the height) Local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally. [ 75 ] Gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function . Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks , [ 76 ] through the backpropagation algorithm. Another type of local search is evolutionary computation , which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by \"mutating\" and \"recombining\" them, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation. [ 77 ] Distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking ) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails ). [ 78 ] Logic Formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation . ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 81 ] Deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement ( conclusion ) from other statements that are given and assumed to be true (the premises ). [ 82 ] Proofs can be structured as proof trees , in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules . Given a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms . In the case of Horn clauses , problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem. [ 83 ] In the more general case of the clausal form of first-order logic , resolution is a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved. [ 84 ] Inference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is undecidable , and therefore intractable . However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the logic programming language Prolog , is Turing complete . Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages. [ 85 ] Fuzzy logic assigns a \"degree of truth\" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true. [ 86 ] Non-monotonic logics , including logic programming with negation as failure , are designed to handle default reasoning . [ 28 ] Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains. Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning A simple Bayesian network , with the associated conditional probability tables Many problems in AI (including reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics. [ 87 ] Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory , decision analysis , [ 88 ] and information value theory . [ 89 ] These tools include models such as Markov decision processes , [ 90 ] dynamic decision networks , [ 91 ] game theory and mechanism design . [ 92 ] Bayesian networks [ 93 ] are a tool that can be used for reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm), [ g ] [ 95 ] learning (using the expectation–maximization algorithm ), [ h ] [ 97 ] planning (using decision networks ) [ 98 ] and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks ). [ 91 ] Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data, thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters ). [ 91 ] Expectation–maximization clustering of Old Faithful eruption data starts from a random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption. Classifiers and statistical learning methods The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g., \"if shiny then diamond\"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g., \"if diamond then pick up\"), on the other hand.

They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning . Each pattern (also called an \" observation \") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set . When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience. [ 45 ] There are many kinds of classifiers in use. [ 100 ] The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm. [ 101 ] K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s. [ 102 ] The naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\" [ 103 ] at Google, due in part to its scalability. [ 104 ] Neural networks are also used as classifiers. [ 105 ] Artificial neural networks A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain . An artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons , which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers. [ 105 ] Learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm. [ 106 ] Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function. [ 107 ] In feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction. [ 108 ] The term perceptron typically refers to a single-layer neural network. [ 109 ] In contrast, deep learning uses many layers. [ 110 ] Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events. Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) are recurrent neural networks that better preserve longterm dependencies and are less sensitive to the vanishing gradient problem . [ 111 ] Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use layers of kernels to more efficiently process local patterns. This local processing is especially important in image processing , where the early CNN layers typically identify simple local patterns such as edges and curves, with subsequent layers detecting more complex patterns like textures, and eventually whole objects. [ 112 ] Deep learning Deep learning is a subset of machine learning , which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence. [ 113 ] Deep learning uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs. [ 110 ] The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing , lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces. [ 114 ] Deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision , speech recognition , natural language processing , image classification , [ 115 ] and others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2021. [ 116 ] The sudden success of deep learning in 2012–2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s) [ i ] but because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs ) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet . [ j ] GPT Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models (LLMs) that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences. Text-based GPT models are pre-trained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called \" hallucinations \". These can be reduced with RLHF and quality data, but the problem has been getting worse for reasoning systems. [ 124 ] Such systems are used in chatbots , which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text. [ 125 ] [ 126 ] Current models and services include ChatGPT , Claude , Gemini , Copilot , and Meta AI . [ 127 ] Multimodal GPT models can process different types of data ( modalities ) such as images, videos, sound, and text.

Improvements in GPUs have been even faster, [ 132 ] a trend sometimes called Huang's law , [ 133 ] named after Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang .

[ 134 ] Through the lens of the Hippocratic Oath , medical professionals are ethically compelled to use AI, if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients. [ 135 ] [ 136 ] For medical research, AI is an important tool for processing and integrating big data . This is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication. [ 137 ] It has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research. [ 137 ] [ 138 ] New AI tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways. For example, AlphaFold 2 (2021) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein . [ 139 ] In 2023, it was reported that AI-guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria. [ 140 ] In 2024, researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for Parkinson's disease drug treatments. Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping, or aggregation, of alpha-synuclein (the protein that characterises Parkinson's disease). They were able to speed up the initial screening process ten-fold and reduce the cost by a thousand-fold. [ 141 ] [ 142 ] Games Main article: Artificial intelligence in video games Game playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI's most advanced techniques. [ 143 ] Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov , on 11 May 1997. [ 144 ] In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM 's question answering system , Watson , defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings , by a significant margin. [ 145 ] In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol , becoming the first computer Go -playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps . Then, in 2017, it defeated Ke Jie , who was the best Go player in the world. [ 146 ] Other programs handle imperfect-information games, such as the poker -playing program Pluribus . [ 147 ] DeepMind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models, such as with MuZero , which could be trained to play chess, Go, or Atari games. [ 148 ] In 2019, DeepMind's AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II , a particularly challenging real-time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map.

[ 153 ] A February 2024 study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low, even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data. [ 154 ] One technique to improve their performance involves training the models to produce correct reasoning steps, rather than just the correct result.

[ 177 ] [ 178 ] Generative AI tools have become more common since the AI boom in the 2020s. This boom was made possible by improvements in transformer -based deep neural networks , particularly large language models (LLMs). Major tools include chatbots such as ChatGPT , Copilot , Gemini , Claude , Grok , and DeepSeek ; text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion , Midjourney , and DALL-E ; and text-to-video models such as Veo and Sora .

[ 194 ] The production of generative AI systems requires large scale data centers using specialized chips which require a lot of electricity for processing and water for cooling. [ 195 ] Agents Main article: Agentic AI AI agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents. AI agents are used in various applications, including virtual assistants , chatbots , autonomous vehicles , game-playing systems , and industrial robotics . AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities. In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution. Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training. Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks. [ 196 ] [ 197 ] [ 198 ] Web search Microsoft introduced Copilot Search in February 2023 under the name Bing Chat , as a built-in feature for Microsoft Edge and Bing mobile app. Copilot Search provides AI-generated summaries [ 199 ] and step-by-step reasoning based of information from web publishers, ranked in Bing Search. [ 200 ] For safety, Copilot uses AI-based classifiers and filters to reduce potentially harmful content. [ 201 ] Google officially pushed its AI Search at its Google I/O event on May 20, 2025. [ 202 ] It keeps people looking at Google instead of clicking on a search result. AI Overviews uses Gemini 2.5 to provide contextual answers to user queries based on web content. [ 203 ] Sexuality Applications of AI in this domain include AI-enabled menstruation and fertility trackers that analyze user data to offer predictions, [ 204 ] AI-integrated sex toys (e.g., teledildonics ), [ 205 ] AI-generated sexual education content, [ 206 ] and AI agents that simulate sexual and romantic partners (e.g., Replika ). [ 207 ] AI is also used for the production of non-consensual deepfake pornography , raising significant ethical and legal concerns. [ 208 ] AI technologies have also been used to attempt to identify online gender-based violence and online sexual grooming of minors. [ 209 ] [ 210 ] Other industry-specific tasks There are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported having incorporated \"AI\" in some offerings or processes. [ 211 ] A few examples are energy storage , medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions, foreign policy , or supply chain management. AI applications for evacuation and disaster management are growing. AI has been used to investigate patterns in large-scale and small-scale evacuations using historical data from GPS, videos or social media. Furthermore, AI can provide real-time information on the evacuation conditions. [ 212 ] [ 213 ] [ 214 ] In agriculture, AI has helped farmers to increase yield and identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments. Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct predictive analytics , classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water. Artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for \"classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights.\" For example, it is used for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy.

[ 215 ] Ethics Main article: Ethics of artificial intelligence Street art in Tel Aviv [ 216 ] [ 217 ] AI has potential benefits and potential risks. [ 218 ] AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: Demis Hassabis of DeepMind hopes to \"solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else\". [ 219 ] However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified. [ 220 ] [ 221 ] In-production systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their AI training processes, especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning. [ 222 ] Risks and harm Privacy and copyright Further information: Information privacy and Artificial intelligence and copyright Machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy , surveillance and copyright . AI-powered devices and services, such as virtual assistants and IoT products, continuously collect personal information, raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties. The loss of privacy is further exacerbated by AI's ability to process and combine vast amounts of data, potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency. Sensitive user data collected may include online activity records, geolocation data, video, or audio. [ 223 ] For example, in order to build speech recognition algorithms, Amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them. [ 224 ] Opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy . [ 225 ] AI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such as data aggregation , de-identification and differential privacy . [ 226 ] Since 2016, some privacy experts, such as Cynthia Dwork , have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness . Brian Christian wrote that experts have pivoted \"from the question of 'what they know' to the question of 'what they're doing with it'.\" [ 227 ] Generative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under the rationale of \" fair use \". Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include \"the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work\" and \"the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work\". [ 228 ] [ 229 ] Website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a \" robots.txt \" file. [ 230 ] In 2023, leading authors (including John Grisham and Jonathan Franzen ) sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI.

[ 237 ] [ 238 ] Power needs and environmental impacts See also: Environmental impacts of artificial intelligence In January 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released Electricity 2024, Analysis and Forecast to 2026 , forecasting electric power use. [ 239 ] This is the first IEA report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. The report states that power demand for these uses might double by 2026, with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole Japanese nation. [ 240 ] Prodigious power consumption by AI is responsible for the growth of fossil fuel use, and might delay closings of obsolete, carbon-emitting coal energy facilities. There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US, making large technology firms (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon) into voracious consumers of electric power. Projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search. The large firms are in haste to find power sources – from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. The tech firms argue that – in the long view – AI will be eventually kinder to the environment, but they need the energy now. AI makes the power grid more efficient and \"intelligent\", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to technology firms. [ 241 ] A 2024 Goldman Sachs Research Paper, AI Data Centers and the Coming US Power Demand Surge , found \"US power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation....\" and forecasts that, by 2030, US data centers will consume 8% of US power, as opposed to 3% in 2022, presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means. [ 242 ] Data centers' need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid. The Big Tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all. [ 243 ] In 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that big AI companies have begun negotiations with the US nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers. In March 2024 Amazon purchased a Pennsylvania nuclear-powered data center for US$650 million. [ 244 ] Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers. [ 245 ] In September 2024, Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation Energy to re-open the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100% of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years. Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission . If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power – enough for 800,000 homes – of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at US$1.6 billion and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act . [ 246 ] The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost US$2 billion to reopen the Palisades Nuclear reactor on Lake Michigan. Closed since 2022, the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO of Exelon who was responsible for Exelon's spinoff of Constellation.

[ 248 ] Although most nuclear plants in Japan have been shut down after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident , according to an October 2024 Bloomberg article in Japanese, cloud gaming services company Ubitus, in which Nvidia has a stake, is looking for land in Japan near a nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative AI. [ 249 ] Ubitus CEO Wesley Kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient, cheap and stable power for AI. [ 249 ] On 1 November 2024, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected an application submitted by Talen Energy for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station Susquehanna to Amazon's data center. [ 250 ] According to the Commission Chairman Willie L. Phillips , it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors. [ 250 ] In 2025, a report prepared by the International Energy Agency estimated the greenhouse gas emissions from the energy consumption of AI at 180 million tons. By 2035, these emissions could rise to 300–500 million tonnes depending on what measures will be taken. This is below 1.5% of the energy sector emissions. The emissions reduction potential of AI was estimated at 5% of the energy sector emissions, but rebound effects (for example if people switch from public transport to autonomous cars) can reduce it.

[ 267 ] The field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases. On June 28, 2015, Google Photos 's new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as \"gorillas\" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people, [ 268 ] a problem called \"sample size disparity\". [ 269 ] Google \"fixed\" this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a \"gorilla\".

Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different—the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend. [ 271 ] In 2017, several researchers [ l ] showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data. [ 273 ] A program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as \"race\" or \"gender\"). The feature will correlate with other features (like \"address\", \"shopping history\" or \"first name\"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on \"race\" or \"gender\". [ 274 ] Moritz Hardt said \"the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn't work.\" [ 275 ] Criticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make \"predictions\" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions as recommendations , some of these \"recommendations\" will likely be racist.

One broad category is distributive fairness , which focuses on the outcomes, often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities. Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative stereotypes or render certain groups invisible. Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases, but it may conflict with anti-discrimination laws . [ 263 ] At its 2022 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT 2022), the Association for Computing Machinery , in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings that recommend that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe, and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed.

[ 281 ] Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at \"low risk\" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading. [ 282 ] People who have been harmed by an algorithm's decision have a right to an explanation.

SHAP enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output. [ 286 ] LIME can locally approximate a model's outputs with a simpler, interpretable model. [ 287 ] Multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned.

[ 298 ] Technological unemployment Main articles: Workplace impact of artificial intelligence and Technological unemployment Economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment. [ 299 ] In the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that \"we're in uncharted territory\" with AI. [ 300 ] A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment , but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed . [ 301 ] Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimated 47% of U.S. jobs are at \"high risk\" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9% of U.S. jobs as \"high risk\". [ p ] [ 303 ] The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies. [ 299 ] In April 2023, it was reported that 70% of the jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence. [ 304 ] [ 305 ] Unlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist stated in 2015 that \"the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution\" is \"worth taking seriously\". [ 306 ] Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy. [ 307 ] From the early days of the development of artificial intelligence, there have been arguments, for example, those put forward by Joseph Weizenbaum , about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement. [ 308 ] Existential risk Main article: Existential risk from artificial intelligence It has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as physicist Stephen Hawking stated, \" spell the end of the human race \". [ 309 ] This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like \"self-awareness\" (or \"sentience\" or \"consciousness\") and becomes a malevolent character. [ q ] These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways. First, AI does not require human-like sentience to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of a paperclip maximizer ). [ 311 ] Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that \"you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead.\" [ 312 ] In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity's morality and values so that it is \"fundamentally on our side\". [ 313 ] Second, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like ideologies , law , government , money and the economy are built on language ; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive. [ 314 ] The opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI. [ 315 ] Personalities such as Stephen Hawking , Bill Gates , and Elon Musk , [ 316 ] as well as AI pioneers such as Yoshua Bengio , Stuart Russell , Demis Hassabis , and Sam Altman , have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI. In May 2023, Geoffrey Hinton announced his resignation from Google in order to be able to \"freely speak out about the risks of AI\" without \"considering how this impacts Google\". [ 317 ] He notably mentioned risks of an AI takeover , [ 318 ] and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes, establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI. [ 319 ] In 2023, many leading AI experts endorsed the joint statement that \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\". [ 320 ] Some other researchers were more optimistic. AI pioneer Jürgen Schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95% of all cases, AI research is about making \"human lives longer and healthier and easier.\" [ 321 ] While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, \"they can also be used against the bad actors.\" [ 322 ] [ 323 ] Andrew Ng also argued that \"it's a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI—and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests.\" [ 324 ] Yann LeCun \"scoffs at his peers' dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction.\" [ 325 ] In the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine.

[ 327 ] Ethical machines and alignment Main articles: Machine ethics , AI safety , Friendly artificial intelligence , Artificial moral agents , and Human Compatible Friendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. Eliezer Yudkowsky , who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk. [ 328 ] Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas. [ 329 ] The field of machine ethics is also called computational morality, [ 329 ] and was founded at an AAAI symposium in 2005. [ 330 ] Other approaches include Wendell Wallach 's \"artificial moral agents\" [ 331 ] and Stuart J. Russell 's three principles for developing provably beneficial machines. [ 332 ] Open source See also: Lists of open-source artificial intelligence software Active organizations in the AI open-source community include Hugging Face , [ 333 ] Google , [ 334 ] EleutherAI and Meta . [ 335 ] Various AI models, such as Llama 2 , Mistral or Stable Diffusion , have been made open-weight, [ 336 ] [ 337 ] meaning that their architecture and trained parameters (the \"weights\") are publicly available. Open-weight models can be freely fine-tuned , which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case. [ 338 ] Open-weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused. Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as objecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities (such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism ) and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed. They recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses. [ 339 ] Frameworks Artificial intelligence projects can be guided by ethical considerations during the design, development, and implementation of an AI system. An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework, developed by the Alan Turing Institute and based on the SUM values, outlines four main ethical dimensions, defined as follows: [ 340 ] [ 341 ] Respect the dignity of individual people Connect with other people sincerely, openly, and inclusively Care for the wellbeing of everyone Protect social values, justice, and the public interest Other developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the Asilomar Conference , the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, and the IEEE's Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative, among others; [ 342 ] however, these principles are not without criticism, especially regarding the people chosen to contribute to these frameworks. [ 343 ] Promotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of AI system design, development and implementation, and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists, product managers, data engineers, domain experts, and delivery managers. [ 344 ] The UK AI Safety Institute released in 2024 a testing toolset called 'Inspect' for AI safety evaluations available under an MIT open-source licence which is freely available on GitHub and can be improved with third-party packages. It can be used to evaluate AI models in a range of areas including core knowledge, ability to reason, and autonomous capabilities. [ 345 ] Regulation Main articles: Regulation of artificial intelligence , Regulation of algorithms , and AI safety The first global AI Safety Summit was held in the United Kingdom in November 2023 with a declaration calling for international cooperation. The regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI; it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms. [ 346 ] The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally. [ 347 ] According to AI Index at Stanford , the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone. [ 348 ] [ 349 ] Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI. [ 350 ] Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, U.S., and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia. [ 350 ] The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology. [ 350 ] Henry Kissinger , Eric Schmidt , and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI. [ 351 ] In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years. [ 352 ] In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, government officials and academics. [ 353 ] On 1 August 2024, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act entered into force, establishing the first comprehensive EU-wide AI regulation. [ 354 ] In 2024, the Council of Europe created the first international legally binding treaty on AI, called the \" Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law \". It was adopted by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other signatories. [ 355 ] In a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only 35% of Americans, agreed that \"products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks\". [ 348 ] A 2023 Reuters /Ipsos poll found that 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity. [ 356 ] In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35% of Americans thought it \"very important\", and an additional 41% thought it \"somewhat important\", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13% responding \"not very important\" and 8% responding \"not at all important\". [ 357 ] [ 358 ] In November 2023, the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks. [ 359 ] 28 countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of the summit, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence. [ 360 ] [ 361 ] In May 2024 at the AI Seoul Summit , 16 global AI tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of AI. [ 362 ] [ 363 ] History Main article: History of artificial intelligence For a chronological guide, see Timeline of artificial intelligence . In 2024, AI patents in China and the US numbered more than three-fourths of AI patents worldwide. [ 364 ] Though China had more AI patents, the US had 35% more patents per AI patent-applicant company than China. [ 364 ] The study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing 's theory of computation , which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning. [ 365 ] [ 366 ] This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics , information theory and neurobiology , led researchers to consider the possibility of building an \"electronic brain\". [ r ] They developed several areas of research that would become part of AI, [ 368 ] such as McCulloch and Pitts design for \"artificial neurons\" in 1943, [ 117 ] and Turing's influential 1950 paper ' Computing Machinery and Intelligence ', which introduced the Turing test and showed that \"machine intelligence\" was plausible. [ 369 ] [ 366 ] The field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956. [ s ] [ 6 ] The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s. [ t ] They and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\": [ u ] computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English. [ v ] [ 7 ] Artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and U.S. universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s. [ 366 ] Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field. [ 373 ] In 1965 Herbert Simon predicted, \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\". [ 374 ] In 1967 Marvin Minsky agreed, writing that \"within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved\". [ 375 ] They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 378 ] Minsky and Papert 's book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether. [ 379 ] The \" AI winter \", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed. [ 9 ] In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems , [ 380 ] a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research . [ 8 ] However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began. [ 10 ] Up to this point, most of AI's funding had gone to projects that used high-level symbols to represent mental objects like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception , robotics , learning and pattern recognition , [ 381 ] and began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches. [ 382 ] Rodney Brooks rejected \"representation\" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive. [ x ] Judea Pearl , Lotfi Zadeh , and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic. [ 87 ] [ 387 ] But the most important development was the revival of \" connectionism \", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others. [ 388 ] In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks. [ 389 ] AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems.

[ 390 ] By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as \"artificial intelligence\" (a tendency known as the AI effect ). [ 391 ] However, several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or \"AGI\"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s. [ 68 ] Deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ y ] Deep learning's success was based on both hardware improvements ( faster computers , [ 393 ] graphics processing units , cloud computing [ 394 ] ) and access to large amounts of data [ 395 ] (including curated datasets, [ 394 ] such as ImageNet ). Deep learning's success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI. [ z ] The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019. [ 350 ] The number of Google searches for the term \"AI\" accelerated in 2022. In 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. The alignment problem became a serious field of academic study. [ 327 ] In the late 2010s and early 2020s, AGI companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest. In 2015, AlphaGo , developed by DeepMind , beat the world champion Go player . The program taught only the game's rules and developed a strategy by itself. GPT-3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of generating high-quality human-like text. [ 396 ] ChatGPT , launched on November 30, 2022, became the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months. [ 397 ] It marked what is widely regarded as AI's breakout year, bringing it into the public consciousness. [ 398 ] These programs, and others, inspired an aggressive AI boom , where large companies began investing billions of dollars in AI research. According to AI Impacts, about US$50 billion annually was invested in \"AI\" around 2022 in the U.S. alone and about 20% of the new U.S. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in \"AI\". [ 399 ] About 800,000 \"AI\"-related U.S. job openings existed in 2022. [ 400 ] According to PitchBook research, 22% of newly funded startups in 2024 claimed to be AI companies. [ 401 ] Philosophy Main article: Philosophy of artificial intelligence Philosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines. [ 402 ] Another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious, and the associated ethical implications. [ 403 ] Many other topics in philosophy are relevant to AI, such as epistemology and free will . [ 404 ] Rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of AI . [ 403 ] Defining artificial intelligence See also: Synthetic intelligence , Intelligent agent , Artificial mind , Virtual intelligence , and Dartmouth workshop Alan Turing wrote in 1950 \"I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?\" [ 405 ] He advised changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\". [ 405 ] He devised the Turing test , which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation. [ 369 ] Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\". Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks.\" [ 406 ] The Turing test can provide some evidence of intelligence, but it penalizes non-human intelligent behavior. [ 407 ] Russell and Norvig agree with Turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior, not internal structure. [ 1 ] However, they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans. \" Aeronautical engineering texts\", they wrote, \"do not define the goal of their field as making 'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons. ' \" [ 408 ] AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\". [ 409 ] McCarthy defines intelligence as \"the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world\". [ 410 ] Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky , similarly describes it as \"the ability to solve hard problems\". [ 411 ] The leading AI textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. [ 1 ] These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the \"intelligence\" of the machine—and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible. Another definition has been adopted by Google, [ 412 ] a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence. As a result of the many circulating definitions scholars have started to critically analyze and order the AI discourse itself [ 413 ] including discussing the many AI narratives and myths to be found within societal, political and academic discourses. [ 414 ] Similarly, in practice, some authors have suggested that the term 'AI' is often used too broadly and vaguely. This raises the question of where the line should be drawn between AI and classical algorithms, [ 415 ] with many companies during the early 2020s AI boom using the term as a marketing buzzword , often even if they did \"not actually use AI in a material way\". [ 416 ] There has been debate over whether large language models exhibit genuine intelligence or merely simulate it by imitating human text . [ 417 ] Evaluating approaches to AI No established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history. [ aa ] The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\"). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic , soft and narrow . ", "strategy": "semantic"}

Symbolic AI and its limits Symbolic AI (or \" GOFAI \") [ 419 ] simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis : \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\" [ 420 ] However, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning . Moravec's paradox is the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for AI, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult. [ 421 ] Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge. [ 422 ] Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him. [ ab ] [ 16 ] The issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias . Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence, [ 424 ] [ 425 ] in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI : it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches. Neat vs. scruffy Main article: Neats and scruffies \"Neats\" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic , optimization , or neural networks ). \"Scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s, [ 426 ] but eventually was seen as irrelevant. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 15 ] Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms , fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks. Narrow vs. general AI Main articles: Weak artificial intelligence and Artificial general intelligence AI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field's long-term goals. [ 427 ] [ 428 ] General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively. Machine consciousness, sentience, and mind Main articles: Philosophy of artificial intelligence and Artificial consciousness There is no settled consensus in philosophy of mind on whether a machine can have a mind , consciousness and mental states in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence.

[ 431 ] Computationalism and functionalism Main articles: Computational theory of mind and Functionalism (philosophy of mind) Computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind–body problem . This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam . [ 432 ] Philosopher John Searle characterized this position as \" strong AI \": \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\" [ ac ] Searle challenges this claim with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind. [ 436 ] AI welfare and rights It is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient (has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree. [ 437 ] But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals. [ 438 ] [ 439 ] Sapience (a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment or self-awareness ) may provide another moral basis for AI rights. [ 438 ] Robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society. [ 440 ] In 2017, the European Union considered granting \"electronic personhood\" to some of the most capable AI systems. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities. [ 441 ] Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of human rights , and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios. They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part in society on their own. [ 442 ] [ 443 ] Progress in AI increased interest in the topic. Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny. They warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming , which could lead to large-scale suffering if sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited. [ 439 ] [ 438 ] Future Superintelligence and the singularity A superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind. [ 428 ] If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself . The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I. J. Good called an \" intelligence explosion \" and Vernor Vinge called a \" singularity \". [ 444 ] However, technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely, and typically follow an S-shaped curve , slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do. [ 445 ] Transhumanism Main article: Transhumanism Robot designer Hans Moravec , cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger . [ 446 ] Edward Fredkin argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution\", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler 's \" Darwin among the Machines \" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his 1998 book Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence . [ 447 ] In fiction Main article: Artificial intelligence in fiction The word \"robot\" itself was coined by Karel Čapek in his 1921 play R.U.R. , the title standing for \"Rossum's Universal Robots\". Thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity, [ 448 ] and have been a persistent theme in science fiction . [ 449 ] A common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein , where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke's and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000 , the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture. [ 450 ] Isaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many stories, most notably with the \" Multivac \" super-intelligent computer. Asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics; [ 451 ] while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity. [ 452 ] Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel , and thus to suffer. This appears in Karel Čapek 's R.U.R. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. [ 1 ] High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search ); recommendation systems (used by YouTube , Amazon , and Netflix ); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant , Siri , and Alexa ); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo ); generative and creative tools (e.g., language models and AI art ); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go ). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore .\" [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning , knowledge representation , planning , natural language processing , perception , and support for robotics . [ a ] To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization , formal logic , artificial neural networks , and methods based on statistics , operations research , and economics . [ b ] AI also draws upon psychology , linguistics , philosophy , neuroscience , and other fields. [ 4 ] Some companies, such as OpenAI , Google DeepMind and Meta , [ 5 ] aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI)—AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human. Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, [ 6 ] and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history , [ 7 ] [ 8 ] followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. [ 11 ] This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture . [ 12 ] In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom . Generative AI's ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms, which has raised ethical concerns about AI's long-term effects and potential existential risks , prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology. Goals The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research. [ a ] Reasoning and problem-solving Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions . [ 13 ] By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics . [ 14 ] Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow. [ 15 ] Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

Knowledge representation An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts. Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering [ 17 ] allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval, [ 18 ] scene interpretation, [ 19 ] clinical decision support, [ 20 ] knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases ), [ 21 ] and other areas. [ 22 ] A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge. [ 23 ] Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects; [ 24 ] situations, events, states, and time; [ 25 ] causes and effects; [ 26 ] knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know); [ 27 ] default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing); [ 28 ] and many other aspects and domains of knowledge. Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous); [ 29 ] and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally). [ 16 ] There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition , the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications. [ c ] Planning and decision-making An \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen. [ d ] [ 32 ] In automated planning , the agent has a specific goal. [ 33 ] In automated decision-making , the agent has preferences—there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \" utility \") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the \" expected utility \": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility. [ 34 ] In classical planning , the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be. [ 35 ] In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is \"unknown\" or \"unobservable\") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not \"deterministic\"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked. [ 36 ] In some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning ), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences. [ 37 ] Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions. [ 38 ] The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be. A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g., by iteration ), be heuristic , or it can be learned. [ 39 ] Game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents. [ 40 ] Learning Machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically. [ 41 ] It has been a part of AI from the beginning. [ e ] In supervised learning , the training data is labelled with the expected answers, while in unsupervised learning , the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data. There are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance. [ 44 ] Supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input). [ 45 ] In reinforcement learning , the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as \"good\". [ 46 ] Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem. [ 47 ] Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning. [ 48 ] Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity , by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization . [ 49 ] Natural language processing Natural language processing (NLP) allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages. [ 50 ] Specific problems include speech recognition , speech synthesis , machine translation , information extraction , information retrieval and question answering . [ 51 ] Early work, based on Noam Chomsky 's generative grammar and semantic networks , had difficulty with word-sense disambiguation [ f ] unless restricted to small domains called \" micro-worlds \" (due to the common sense knowledge problem [ 29 ] ). Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure. Modern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning), [ 52 ] transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism), [ 53 ] and others. [ 54 ] In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or \"GPT\") language models began to generate coherent text, [ 55 ] [ 56 ] and by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam , SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications. [ 57 ] Perception Machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar , sonar, radar, and tactile sensors ) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input. [ 58 ] The field includes speech recognition , [ 59 ] image classification , [ 60 ] facial recognition , object recognition , [ 61 ] object tracking , [ 62 ] and robotic perception .

[ 64 ] Affective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human feeling, emotion, and mood . [ 65 ] For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction . However, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents. [ 66 ] Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis , wherein AI classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject.

[ b ] Search and optimization AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions. [ 69 ] There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search . State space search State space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state. [ 70 ] For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis . [ 71 ] Simple exhaustive searches [ 72 ] are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers . The result is a search that is too slow or never completes. [ 15 ] \" Heuristics \" or \"rules of thumb\" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal. [ 73 ] Adversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves, looking for a winning position. [ 74 ] Local search Illustration of gradient descent for 3 different starting points; two parameters (represented by the plan coordinates) are adjusted in order to minimize the loss function (the height) Local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally. [ 75 ] Gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function . Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks , [ 76 ] through the backpropagation algorithm. Another type of local search is evolutionary computation , which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by \"mutating\" and \"recombining\" them, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation. [ 77 ] Distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking ) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails ). [ 78 ] Logic Formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation . ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 81 ] Deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement ( conclusion ) from other statements that are given and assumed to be true (the premises ). [ 82 ] Proofs can be structured as proof trees , in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules . Given a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms . In the case of Horn clauses , problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem. [ 83 ] In the more general case of the clausal form of first-order logic , resolution is a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved. [ 84 ] Inference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is undecidable , and therefore intractable . However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the logic programming language Prolog , is Turing complete . Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages. [ 85 ] Fuzzy logic assigns a \"degree of truth\" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true. [ 86 ] Non-monotonic logics , including logic programming with negation as failure , are designed to handle default reasoning . [ 28 ] Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains. Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning A simple Bayesian network , with the associated conditional probability tables Many problems in AI (including reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics. [ 87 ] Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory , decision analysis , [ 88 ] and information value theory . [ 89 ] These tools include models such as Markov decision processes , [ 90 ] dynamic decision networks , [ 91 ] game theory and mechanism design . [ 92 ] Bayesian networks [ 93 ] are a tool that can be used for reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm), [ g ] [ 95 ] learning (using the expectation–maximization algorithm ), [ h ] [ 97 ] planning (using decision networks ) [ 98 ] and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks ). [ 91 ] Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data, thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters ). [ 91 ] Expectation–maximization clustering of Old Faithful eruption data starts from a random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption. Classifiers and statistical learning methods The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g., \"if shiny then diamond\"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g., \"if diamond then pick up\"), on the other hand.

They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning . Each pattern (also called an \" observation \") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set . When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience. [ 45 ] There are many kinds of classifiers in use. [ 100 ] The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm. [ 101 ] K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s. [ 102 ] The naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\" [ 103 ] at Google, due in part to its scalability. [ 104 ] Neural networks are also used as classifiers. [ 105 ] Artificial neural networks A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain . An artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons , which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain.

Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers. [ 105 ] Learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm. [ 106 ] Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function. [ 107 ] In feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction. [ 108 ] The term perceptron typically refers to a single-layer neural network. [ 109 ] In contrast, deep learning uses many layers. [ 110 ] Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events. Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) are recurrent neural networks that better preserve longterm dependencies and are less sensitive to the vanishing gradient problem . [ 111 ] Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use layers of kernels to more efficiently process local patterns. This local processing is especially important in image processing , where the early CNN layers typically identify simple local patterns such as edges and curves, with subsequent layers detecting more complex patterns like textures, and eventually whole objects. [ 112 ] Deep learning Deep learning is a subset of machine learning , which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence. [ 113 ] Deep learning uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs. [ 110 ] The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing , lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces. [ 114 ] Deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision , speech recognition , natural language processing , image classification , [ 115 ] and others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2021. [ 116 ] The sudden success of deep learning in 2012–2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s) [ i ] but because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs ) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet . [ j ] GPT Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models (LLMs) that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences. Text-based GPT models are pre-trained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called \" hallucinations \". These can be reduced with RLHF and quality data, but the problem has been getting worse for reasoning systems. [ 124 ] Such systems are used in chatbots , which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text. [ 125 ] [ 126 ] Current models and services include ChatGPT , Claude , Gemini , Copilot , and Meta AI . [ 127 ] Multimodal GPT models can process different types of data ( modalities ) such as images, videos, sound, and text.

[ 134 ] Through the lens of the Hippocratic Oath , medical professionals are ethically compelled to use AI, if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients. [ 135 ] [ 136 ] For medical research, AI is an important tool for processing and integrating big data . This is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication. [ 137 ] It has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research. [ 137 ] [ 138 ] New AI tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways. For example, AlphaFold 2 (2021) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein . [ 139 ] In 2023, it was reported that AI-guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria. [ 140 ] In 2024, researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for Parkinson's disease drug treatments. Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping, or aggregation, of alpha-synuclein (the protein that characterises Parkinson's disease). They were able to speed up the initial screening process ten-fold and reduce the cost by a thousand-fold. [ 141 ] [ 142 ] Games Main article: Artificial intelligence in video games Game playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI's most advanced techniques. [ 143 ] Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov , on 11 May 1997. [ 144 ] In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM 's question answering system , Watson , defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings , by a significant margin. [ 145 ] In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol , becoming the first computer Go -playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps . Then, in 2017, it defeated Ke Jie , who was the best Go player in the world. [ 146 ] Other programs handle imperfect-information games, such as the poker -playing program Pluribus . [ 147 ] DeepMind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models, such as with MuZero , which could be trained to play chess, Go, or Atari games. [ 148 ] In 2019, DeepMind's AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II , a particularly challenging real-time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map. [ 149 ] In 2021, an AI agent competed in a PlayStation Gran Turismo competition, winning against four of the world's best Gran Turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning. [ 150 ] In 2024, Google DeepMind introduced SIMA, a type of AI capable of autonomously playing nine previously unseen open-world video games by observing screen output, as well as executing short, specific tasks in response to natural language instructions.

[ 153 ] A February 2024 study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low, even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data. [ 154 ] One technique to improve their performance involves training the models to produce correct reasoning steps, rather than just the correct result. [ 155 ] The Alibaba Group developed a version of its Qwen models called Qwen2-Math , that achieved state-of-the-art performance on several mathematical benchmarks, including 84% accuracy on the MATH dataset of competition mathematics problems.

Finance Finance is one of the fastest growing sectors where applied AI tools are being deployed: from retail online banking to investment advice and insurance, where automated \"robot advisers\" have been in use for some years. [ 164 ] According to Nicolas Firzli, director of the World Pensions & Investments Forum , it may be too early to see the emergence of highly innovative AI-informed financial products and services.

[ 177 ] [ 178 ] Generative AI tools have become more common since the AI boom in the 2020s. This boom was made possible by improvements in transformer -based deep neural networks , particularly large language models (LLMs). Major tools include chatbots such as ChatGPT , Copilot , Gemini , Claude , Grok , and DeepSeek ; text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion , Midjourney , and DALL-E ; and text-to-video models such as Veo and Sora .

[ 194 ] The production of generative AI systems requires large scale data centers using specialized chips which require a lot of electricity for processing and water for cooling. [ 195 ] Agents Main article: Agentic AI AI agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents. AI agents are used in various applications, including virtual assistants , chatbots , autonomous vehicles , game-playing systems , and industrial robotics . AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities. In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution. Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training. Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks. [ 196 ] [ 197 ] [ 198 ] Web search Microsoft introduced Copilot Search in February 2023 under the name Bing Chat , as a built-in feature for Microsoft Edge and Bing mobile app. Copilot Search provides AI-generated summaries [ 199 ] and step-by-step reasoning based of information from web publishers, ranked in Bing Search. [ 200 ] For safety, Copilot uses AI-based classifiers and filters to reduce potentially harmful content. [ 201 ] Google officially pushed its AI Search at its Google I/O event on May 20, 2025. [ 202 ] It keeps people looking at Google instead of clicking on a search result. AI Overviews uses Gemini 2.5 to provide contextual answers to user queries based on web content. [ 203 ] Sexuality Applications of AI in this domain include AI-enabled menstruation and fertility trackers that analyze user data to offer predictions, [ 204 ] AI-integrated sex toys (e.g., teledildonics ), [ 205 ] AI-generated sexual education content, [ 206 ] and AI agents that simulate sexual and romantic partners (e.g., Replika ). [ 207 ] AI is also used for the production of non-consensual deepfake pornography , raising significant ethical and legal concerns. [ 208 ] AI technologies have also been used to attempt to identify online gender-based violence and online sexual grooming of minors. [ 209 ] [ 210 ] Other industry-specific tasks There are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported having incorporated \"AI\" in some offerings or processes. [ 211 ] A few examples are energy storage , medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions, foreign policy , or supply chain management. AI applications for evacuation and disaster management are growing. AI has been used to investigate patterns in large-scale and small-scale evacuations using historical data from GPS, videos or social media. Furthermore, AI can provide real-time information on the evacuation conditions. [ 212 ] [ 213 ] [ 214 ] In agriculture, AI has helped farmers to increase yield and identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments. Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct predictive analytics , classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water. Artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for \"classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights.\" For example, it is used for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy.

[ 215 ] Ethics Main article: Ethics of artificial intelligence Street art in Tel Aviv [ 216 ] [ 217 ] AI has potential benefits and potential risks. [ 218 ] AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: Demis Hassabis of DeepMind hopes to \"solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else\". [ 219 ] However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified. [ 220 ] [ 221 ] In-production systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their AI training processes, especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning. [ 222 ] Risks and harm Privacy and copyright Further information: Information privacy and Artificial intelligence and copyright Machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy , surveillance and copyright . AI-powered devices and services, such as virtual assistants and IoT products, continuously collect personal information, raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties. The loss of privacy is further exacerbated by AI's ability to process and combine vast amounts of data, potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency. Sensitive user data collected may include online activity records, geolocation data, video, or audio. [ 223 ] For example, in order to build speech recognition algorithms, Amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them. [ 224 ] Opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy . [ 225 ] AI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such as data aggregation , de-identification and differential privacy . [ 226 ] Since 2016, some privacy experts, such as Cynthia Dwork , have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness . Brian Christian wrote that experts have pivoted \"from the question of 'what they know' to the question of 'what they're doing with it'.\" [ 227 ] Generative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under the rationale of \" fair use \". Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include \"the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work\" and \"the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work\". [ 228 ] [ 229 ] Website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a \" robots.txt \" file. [ 230 ] In 2023, leading authors (including John Grisham and Jonathan Franzen ) sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI. [ 231 ] [ 232 ] Another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by AI to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors.

There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US, making large technology firms (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon) into voracious consumers of electric power. Projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search. The large firms are in haste to find power sources – from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. The tech firms argue that – in the long view – AI will be eventually kinder to the environment, but they need the energy now. AI makes the power grid more efficient and \"intelligent\", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to technology firms. [ 241 ] A 2024 Goldman Sachs Research Paper, AI Data Centers and the Coming US Power Demand Surge , found \"US power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation....\" and forecasts that, by 2030, US data centers will consume 8% of US power, as opposed to 3% in 2022, presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means. [ 242 ] Data centers' need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid. The Big Tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all. [ 243 ] In 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that big AI companies have begun negotiations with the US nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers. In March 2024 Amazon purchased a Pennsylvania nuclear-powered data center for US$650 million. [ 244 ] Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers. [ 245 ] In September 2024, Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation Energy to re-open the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100% of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years. Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission . If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power – enough for 800,000 homes – of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at US$1.6 billion and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act . [ 246 ] The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost US$2 billion to reopen the Palisades Nuclear reactor on Lake Michigan. Closed since 2022, the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO of Exelon who was responsible for Exelon's spinoff of Constellation. [ 247 ] After the last approval in September 2023, Taiwan suspended the approval of data centers north of Taoyuan with a capacity of more than 5 MW in 2024, due to power supply shortages.

[ 248 ] Although most nuclear plants in Japan have been shut down after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident , according to an October 2024 Bloomberg article in Japanese, cloud gaming services company Ubitus, in which Nvidia has a stake, is looking for land in Japan near a nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative AI. [ 249 ] Ubitus CEO Wesley Kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient, cheap and stable power for AI. [ 249 ] On 1 November 2024, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected an application submitted by Talen Energy for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station Susquehanna to Amazon's data center. [ 250 ] According to the Commission Chairman Willie L. Phillips , it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors. [ 250 ] In 2025, a report prepared by the International Energy Agency estimated the greenhouse gas emissions from the energy consumption of AI at 180 million tons. By 2035, these emissions could rise to 300–500 million tonnes depending on what measures will be taken. This is below 1.5% of the energy sector emissions. The emissions reduction potential of AI was estimated at 5% of the energy sector emissions, but rebound effects (for example if people switch from public transport to autonomous cars) can reduce it.

[ 266 ] [ 264 ] If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people (as it can in medicine , finance , recruitment , housing or policing ) then the algorithm may cause discrimination . [ 267 ] The field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases. On June 28, 2015, Google Photos 's new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as \"gorillas\" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people, [ 268 ] a problem called \"sample size disparity\". [ 269 ] Google \"fixed\" this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a \"gorilla\".

In 2016, Julia Angwin at ProPublica discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different—the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend. [ 271 ] In 2017, several researchers [ l ] showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data. [ 273 ] A program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as \"race\" or \"gender\"). The feature will correlate with other features (like \"address\", \"shopping history\" or \"first name\"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on \"race\" or \"gender\". [ 274 ] Moritz Hardt said \"the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn't work.\" [ 275 ] Criticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make \"predictions\" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions as recommendations , some of these \"recommendations\" will likely be racist. [ 276 ] Thus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

One broad category is distributive fairness , which focuses on the outcomes, often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities. Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative stereotypes or render certain groups invisible. Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases, but it may conflict with anti-discrimination laws . [ 263 ] At its 2022 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT 2022), the Association for Computing Machinery , in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings that recommend that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe, and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed.

[ 279 ] Particularly with deep neural networks , in which there are many non- linear relationships between inputs and outputs. But some popular explainability techniques exist. [ 280 ] It is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works. There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as \"cancerous\", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale. [ 281 ] Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at \"low risk\" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading. [ 282 ] People who have been harmed by an algorithm's decision have a right to an explanation.

SHAP enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output. [ 286 ] LIME can locally approximate a model's outputs with a simpler, interpretable model. [ 287 ] Multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned. [ 288 ] Deconvolution , DeepDream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned, and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning.

[ 298 ] Technological unemployment Main articles: Workplace impact of artificial intelligence and Technological unemployment Economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment. [ 299 ] In the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that \"we're in uncharted territory\" with AI. [ 300 ] A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment , but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed . [ 301 ] Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimated 47% of U.S. jobs are at \"high risk\" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9% of U.S. jobs as \"high risk\". [ p ] [ 303 ] The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies. [ 299 ] In April 2023, it was reported that 70% of the jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence. [ 304 ] [ 305 ] Unlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist stated in 2015 that \"the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution\" is \"worth taking seriously\". [ 306 ] Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy. [ 307 ] From the early days of the development of artificial intelligence, there have been arguments, for example, those put forward by Joseph Weizenbaum , about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement. [ 308 ] Existential risk Main article: Existential risk from artificial intelligence It has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as physicist Stephen Hawking stated, \" spell the end of the human race \". [ 309 ] This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like \"self-awareness\" (or \"sentience\" or \"consciousness\") and becomes a malevolent character. [ q ] These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways. First, AI does not require human-like sentience to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of a paperclip maximizer ). [ 311 ] Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that \"you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead.\" [ 312 ] In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity's morality and values so that it is \"fundamentally on our side\". [ 313 ] Second, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like ideologies , law , government , money and the economy are built on language ; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive. [ 314 ] The opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI. [ 315 ] Personalities such as Stephen Hawking , Bill Gates , and Elon Musk , [ 316 ] as well as AI pioneers such as Yoshua Bengio , Stuart Russell , Demis Hassabis , and Sam Altman , have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI. In May 2023, Geoffrey Hinton announced his resignation from Google in order to be able to \"freely speak out about the risks of AI\" without \"considering how this impacts Google\". [ 317 ] He notably mentioned risks of an AI takeover , [ 318 ] and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes, establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI. [ 319 ] In 2023, many leading AI experts endorsed the joint statement that \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\". [ 320 ] Some other researchers were more optimistic. AI pioneer Jürgen Schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95% of all cases, AI research is about making \"human lives longer and healthier and easier.\" [ 321 ] While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, \"they can also be used against the bad actors.\" [ 322 ] [ 323 ] Andrew Ng also argued that \"it's a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI—and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests.\" [ 324 ] Yann LeCun \"scoffs at his peers' dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction.\" [ 325 ] In the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine.

[ 327 ] Ethical machines and alignment Main articles: Machine ethics , AI safety , Friendly artificial intelligence , Artificial moral agents , and Human Compatible Friendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. Eliezer Yudkowsky , who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk. [ 328 ] Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas. [ 329 ] The field of machine ethics is also called computational morality, [ 329 ] and was founded at an AAAI symposium in 2005. [ 330 ] Other approaches include Wendell Wallach 's \"artificial moral agents\" [ 331 ] and Stuart J. Russell 's three principles for developing provably beneficial machines. [ 332 ] Open source See also: Lists of open-source artificial intelligence software Active organizations in the AI open-source community include Hugging Face , [ 333 ] Google , [ 334 ] EleutherAI and Meta . [ 335 ] Various AI models, such as Llama 2 , Mistral or Stable Diffusion , have been made open-weight, [ 336 ] [ 337 ] meaning that their architecture and trained parameters (the \"weights\") are publicly available. Open-weight models can be freely fine-tuned , which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case. [ 338 ] Open-weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused. Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as objecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities (such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism ) and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed. They recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses. [ 339 ] Frameworks Artificial intelligence projects can be guided by ethical considerations during the design, development, and implementation of an AI system. An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework, developed by the Alan Turing Institute and based on the SUM values, outlines four main ethical dimensions, defined as follows: [ 340 ] [ 341 ] Respect the dignity of individual people Connect with other people sincerely, openly, and inclusively Care for the wellbeing of everyone Protect social values, justice, and the public interest Other developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the Asilomar Conference , the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, and the IEEE's Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative, among others; [ 342 ] however, these principles are not without criticism, especially regarding the people chosen to contribute to these frameworks. [ 343 ] Promotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of AI system design, development and implementation, and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists, product managers, data engineers, domain experts, and delivery managers. [ 344 ] The UK AI Safety Institute released in 2024 a testing toolset called 'Inspect' for AI safety evaluations available under an MIT open-source licence which is freely available on GitHub and can be improved with third-party packages. It can be used to evaluate AI models in a range of areas including core knowledge, ability to reason, and autonomous capabilities. [ 345 ] Regulation Main articles: Regulation of artificial intelligence , Regulation of algorithms , and AI safety The first global AI Safety Summit was held in the United Kingdom in November 2023 with a declaration calling for international cooperation. The regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI; it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms. [ 346 ] The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally. [ 347 ] According to AI Index at Stanford , the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone. [ 348 ] [ 349 ] Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI. [ 350 ] Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, U.S., and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia. [ 350 ] The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology. [ 350 ] Henry Kissinger , Eric Schmidt , and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI. [ 351 ] In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years. [ 352 ] In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, government officials and academics. [ 353 ] On 1 August 2024, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act entered into force, establishing the first comprehensive EU-wide AI regulation. [ 354 ] In 2024, the Council of Europe created the first international legally binding treaty on AI, called the \" Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law \". It was adopted by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other signatories. [ 355 ] In a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only 35% of Americans, agreed that \"products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks\". [ 348 ] A 2023 Reuters /Ipsos poll found that 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity. [ 356 ] In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35% of Americans thought it \"very important\", and an additional 41% thought it \"somewhat important\", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13% responding \"not very important\" and 8% responding \"not at all important\". [ 357 ] [ 358 ] In November 2023, the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks. [ 359 ] 28 countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of the summit, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence. [ 360 ] [ 361 ] In May 2024 at the AI Seoul Summit , 16 global AI tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of AI. [ 362 ] [ 363 ] History Main article: History of artificial intelligence For a chronological guide, see Timeline of artificial intelligence . In 2024, AI patents in China and the US numbered more than three-fourths of AI patents worldwide. [ 364 ] Though China had more AI patents, the US had 35% more patents per AI patent-applicant company than China. [ 364 ] The study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing 's theory of computation , which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning. [ 365 ] [ 366 ] This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics , information theory and neurobiology , led researchers to consider the possibility of building an \"electronic brain\". [ r ] They developed several areas of research that would become part of AI, [ 368 ] such as McCulloch and Pitts design for \"artificial neurons\" in 1943, [ 117 ] and Turing's influential 1950 paper ' Computing Machinery and Intelligence ', which introduced the Turing test and showed that \"machine intelligence\" was plausible. [ 369 ] [ 366 ] The field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956. [ s ] [ 6 ] The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s. [ t ] They and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\": [ u ] computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English. [ v ] [ 7 ] Artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and U.S. universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s. [ 366 ] Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field. [ 373 ] In 1965 Herbert Simon predicted, \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\". [ 374 ] In 1967 Marvin Minsky agreed, writing that \"within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved\". [ 375 ] They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 378 ] Minsky and Papert 's book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether. [ 379 ] The \" AI winter \", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed. [ 9 ] In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems , [ 380 ] a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research . [ 8 ] However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began. [ 10 ] Up to this point, most of AI's funding had gone to projects that used high-level symbols to represent mental objects like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception , robotics , learning and pattern recognition , [ 381 ] and began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches. [ 382 ] Rodney Brooks rejected \"representation\" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive. [ x ] Judea Pearl , Lotfi Zadeh , and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic. [ 87 ] [ 387 ] But the most important development was the revival of \" connectionism \", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others. [ 388 ] In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks. [ 389 ] AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems.

[ 390 ] By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as \"artificial intelligence\" (a tendency known as the AI effect ). [ 391 ] However, several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or \"AGI\"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s. [ 68 ] Deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ y ] Deep learning's success was based on both hardware improvements ( faster computers , [ 393 ] graphics processing units , cloud computing [ 394 ] ) and access to large amounts of data [ 395 ] (including curated datasets, [ 394 ] such as ImageNet ). Deep learning's success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI. [ z ] The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019. [ 350 ] The number of Google searches for the term \"AI\" accelerated in 2022. In 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. The alignment problem became a serious field of academic study. [ 327 ] In the late 2010s and early 2020s, AGI companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest. In 2015, AlphaGo , developed by DeepMind , beat the world champion Go player . The program taught only the game's rules and developed a strategy by itself. GPT-3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of generating high-quality human-like text. [ 396 ] ChatGPT , launched on November 30, 2022, became the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months. [ 397 ] It marked what is widely regarded as AI's breakout year, bringing it into the public consciousness. [ 398 ] These programs, and others, inspired an aggressive AI boom , where large companies began investing billions of dollars in AI research. According to AI Impacts, about US$50 billion annually was invested in \"AI\" around 2022 in the U.S. alone and about 20% of the new U.S. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in \"AI\". [ 399 ] About 800,000 \"AI\"-related U.S. job openings existed in 2022. [ 400 ] According to PitchBook research, 22% of newly funded startups in 2024 claimed to be AI companies. [ 401 ] Philosophy Main article: Philosophy of artificial intelligence Philosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines. [ 402 ] Another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious, and the associated ethical implications. [ 403 ] Many other topics in philosophy are relevant to AI, such as epistemology and free will . [ 404 ] Rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of AI . [ 403 ] Defining artificial intelligence See also: Synthetic intelligence , Intelligent agent , Artificial mind , Virtual intelligence , and Dartmouth workshop Alan Turing wrote in 1950 \"I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?\" [ 405 ] He advised changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\". [ 405 ] He devised the Turing test , which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation. [ 369 ] Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\". Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks.\" [ 406 ] The Turing test can provide some evidence of intelligence, but it penalizes non-human intelligent behavior. [ 407 ] Russell and Norvig agree with Turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior, not internal structure. [ 1 ] However, they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans. \" Aeronautical engineering texts\", they wrote, \"do not define the goal of their field as making 'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons. ' \" [ 408 ] AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\". [ 409 ] McCarthy defines intelligence as \"the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world\". [ 410 ] Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky , similarly describes it as \"the ability to solve hard problems\". [ 411 ] The leading AI textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. [ 1 ] These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the \"intelligence\" of the machine—and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible. Another definition has been adopted by Google, [ 412 ] a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence. As a result of the many circulating definitions scholars have started to critically analyze and order the AI discourse itself [ 413 ] including discussing the many AI narratives and myths to be found within societal, political and academic discourses. [ 414 ] Similarly, in practice, some authors have suggested that the term 'AI' is often used too broadly and vaguely. This raises the question of where the line should be drawn between AI and classical algorithms, [ 415 ] with many companies during the early 2020s AI boom using the term as a marketing buzzword , often even if they did \"not actually use AI in a material way\". [ 416 ] There has been debate over whether large language models exhibit genuine intelligence or merely simulate it by imitating human text . [ 417 ] Evaluating approaches to AI No established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history. [ aa ] The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\"). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic , soft and narrow . ", "strategy": "semantic"}

Symbolic AI and its limits Symbolic AI (or \" GOFAI \") [ 419 ] simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis : \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\" [ 420 ] However, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning . Moravec's paradox is the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for AI, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult. [ 421 ] Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge. [ 422 ] Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him. [ ab ] [ 16 ] The issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias . Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence, [ 424 ] [ 425 ] in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI : it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches. Neat vs. scruffy Main article: Neats and scruffies \"Neats\" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic , optimization , or neural networks ). \"Scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s, [ 426 ] but eventually was seen as irrelevant. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

Soft vs. hard computing Main article: Soft computing Finding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems. [ 15 ] Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms , fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks. Narrow vs. general AI Main articles: Weak artificial intelligence and Artificial general intelligence AI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field's long-term goals. [ 427 ] [ 428 ] General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively. Machine consciousness, sentience, and mind Main articles: Philosophy of artificial intelligence and Artificial consciousness There is no settled consensus in philosophy of mind on whether a machine can have a mind , consciousness and mental states in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence.

The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett's consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion).

[ 431 ] Computationalism and functionalism Main articles: Computational theory of mind and Functionalism (philosophy of mind) Computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind–body problem . This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam . [ 432 ] Philosopher John Searle characterized this position as \" strong AI \": \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\" [ ac ] Searle challenges this claim with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind. [ 436 ] AI welfare and rights It is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient (has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree. [ 437 ] But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals. [ 438 ] [ 439 ] Sapience (a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment or self-awareness ) may provide another moral basis for AI rights. [ 438 ] Robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society. [ 440 ] In 2017, the European Union considered granting \"electronic personhood\" to some of the most capable AI systems. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities. [ 441 ] Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of human rights , and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios. They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part in society on their own. [ 442 ] [ 443 ] Progress in AI increased interest in the topic. Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny. They warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming , which could lead to large-scale suffering if sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited. [ 439 ] [ 438 ] Future Superintelligence and the singularity A superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind. [ 428 ] If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself . The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I. J. Good called an \" intelligence explosion \" and Vernor Vinge called a \" singularity \". [ 444 ] However, technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely, and typically follow an S-shaped curve , slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do. [ 445 ] Transhumanism Main article: Transhumanism Robot designer Hans Moravec , cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger . [ 446 ] Edward Fredkin argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution\", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler 's \" Darwin among the Machines \" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his 1998 book Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence . [ 447 ] In fiction Main article: Artificial intelligence in fiction The word \"robot\" itself was coined by Karel Čapek in his 1921 play R.U.R. , the title standing for \"Rossum's Universal Robots\". Thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity, [ 448 ] and have been a persistent theme in science fiction . [ 449 ] A common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein , where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke's and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000 , the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture. [ 450 ] Isaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many stories, most notably with the \" Multivac \" super-intelligent computer. Asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics; [ 451 ] while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity. [ 452 ] Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel , and thus to suffer. This appears in Karel Čapek 's R.U.R. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. [ 1 ] High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search ); recommendation systems (used by YouTube , Amazon , and Netflix ); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant , Siri , and Alexa ); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo ); generative and creative tools (e.g., language models and AI art ); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go ). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore .\" [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning , knowledge representation , planning , natural language processing , perception , and support for robotics . [ a ] To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization , formal logic , artificial neural networks , and methods based on statistics , operations research , and economics . [ b ] AI also draws upon psychology , linguistics , philosophy , neuroscience , and other fields. [ 4 ] Some companies, such as OpenAI , Google DeepMind and Meta , [ 5 ] aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI)—AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human. Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, [ 6 ] and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history , [ 7 ] [ 8 ] followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. [ 11 ] This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture . [ 12 ] In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom . Generative AI's ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms, which has raised ethical concerns about AI's long-term effects and potential existential risks , prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology. Goals The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research. [ a ] Reasoning and problem-solving Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions . [ 13 ] By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics . [ 14 ] Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow. [ 15 ] Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

Knowledge representation An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts. Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering [ 17 ] allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval, [ 18 ] scene interpretation, [ 19 ] clinical decision support, [ 20 ] knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases ), [ 21 ] and other areas. [ 22 ] A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge. [ 23 ] Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects; [ 24 ] situations, events, states, and time; [ 25 ] causes and effects; [ 26 ] knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know); [ 27 ] default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing); [ 28 ] and many other aspects and domains of knowledge. Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous); [ 29 ] and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally). [ 16 ] There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition , the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications. [ c ] Planning and decision-making An \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen. [ d ] [ 32 ] In automated planning , the agent has a specific goal. [ 33 ] In automated decision-making , the agent has preferences—there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \" utility \") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the \" expected utility \": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility. [ 34 ] In classical planning , the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be. [ 35 ] In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is \"unknown\" or \"unobservable\") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not \"deterministic\"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked. [ 36 ] In some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning ), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences. [ 37 ] Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions. [ 38 ] The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be. A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g., by iteration ), be heuristic , or it can be learned. [ 39 ] Game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents. [ 40 ] Learning Machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically. [ 41 ] It has been a part of AI from the beginning. [ e ] In supervised learning , the training data is labelled with the expected answers, while in unsupervised learning , the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data. There are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance. [ 44 ] Supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input). [ 45 ] In reinforcement learning , the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as \"good\". [ 46 ] Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem. [ 47 ] Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning. [ 48 ] Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity , by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization . [ 49 ] Natural language processing Natural language processing (NLP) allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages. [ 50 ] Specific problems include speech recognition , speech synthesis , machine translation , information extraction , information retrieval and question answering . [ 51 ] Early work, based on Noam Chomsky 's generative grammar and semantic networks , had difficulty with word-sense disambiguation [ f ] unless restricted to small domains called \" micro-worlds \" (due to the common sense knowledge problem [ 29 ] ). Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure. Modern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning), [ 52 ] transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism), [ 53 ] and others. [ 54 ] In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or \"GPT\") language models began to generate coherent text, [ 55 ] [ 56 ] and by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam , SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications. [ 57 ] Perception Machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar , sonar, radar, and tactile sensors ) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input. [ 58 ] The field includes speech recognition , [ 59 ] image classification , [ 60 ] facial recognition , object recognition , [ 61 ] object tracking , [ 62 ] and robotic perception .

[ 64 ] Affective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human feeling, emotion, and mood . [ 65 ] For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction . However, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents.

[ b ] Search and optimization AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions. [ 69 ] There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search . State space search State space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state. [ 70 ] For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis . [ 71 ] Simple exhaustive searches [ 72 ] are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers . The result is a search that is too slow or never completes. [ 15 ] \" Heuristics \" or \"rules of thumb\" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal. [ 73 ] Adversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves, looking for a winning position. [ 74 ] Local search Illustration of gradient descent for 3 different starting points; two parameters (represented by the plan coordinates) are adjusted in order to minimize the loss function (the height) Local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally. [ 75 ] Gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function . Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks , [ 76 ] through the backpropagation algorithm. Another type of local search is evolutionary computation , which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by \"mutating\" and \"recombining\" them, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation. [ 77 ] Distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking ) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails ). [ 78 ] Logic Formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation . ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 81 ] Deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement ( conclusion ) from other statements that are given and assumed to be true (the premises ). [ 82 ] Proofs can be structured as proof trees , in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules . Given a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms . In the case of Horn clauses , problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem. [ 83 ] In the more general case of the clausal form of first-order logic , resolution is a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved. [ 84 ] Inference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is undecidable , and therefore intractable . However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the logic programming language Prolog , is Turing complete . Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages. [ 85 ] Fuzzy logic assigns a \"degree of truth\" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true. [ 86 ] Non-monotonic logics , including logic programming with negation as failure , are designed to handle default reasoning . [ 28 ] Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains. Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning A simple Bayesian network , with the associated conditional probability tables Many problems in AI (including reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics. [ 87 ] Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory , decision analysis , [ 88 ] and information value theory . [ 89 ] These tools include models such as Markov decision processes , [ 90 ] dynamic decision networks , [ 91 ] game theory and mechanism design . [ 92 ] Bayesian networks [ 93 ] are a tool that can be used for reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm), [ g ] [ 95 ] learning (using the expectation–maximization algorithm ), [ h ] [ 97 ] planning (using decision networks ) [ 98 ] and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks ). [ 91 ] Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data, thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters ). [ 91 ] Expectation–maximization clustering of Old Faithful eruption data starts from a random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption. Classifiers and statistical learning methods The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g., \"if shiny then diamond\"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g., \"if diamond then pick up\"), on the other hand.

They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning . Each pattern (also called an \" observation \") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set . When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience. [ 45 ] There are many kinds of classifiers in use. [ 100 ] The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm. [ 101 ] K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s. [ 102 ] The naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\" [ 103 ] at Google, due in part to its scalability. [ 104 ] Neural networks are also used as classifiers. [ 105 ] Artificial neural networks A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain .

Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers. [ 105 ] Learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm. [ 106 ] Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function. [ 107 ] In feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction. [ 108 ] The term perceptron typically refers to a single-layer neural network. [ 109 ] In contrast, deep learning uses many layers. [ 110 ] Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events. Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) are recurrent neural networks that better preserve longterm dependencies and are less sensitive to the vanishing gradient problem . [ 111 ] Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use layers of kernels to more efficiently process local patterns. This local processing is especially important in image processing , where the early CNN layers typically identify simple local patterns such as edges and curves, with subsequent layers detecting more complex patterns like textures, and eventually whole objects. [ 112 ] Deep learning Deep learning is a subset of machine learning , which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence. [ 113 ] Deep learning uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs. [ 110 ] The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing , lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces. [ 114 ] Deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision , speech recognition , natural language processing , image classification , [ 115 ] and others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2021. [ 116 ] The sudden success of deep learning in 2012–2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s) [ i ] but because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs ) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet . [ j ] GPT Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models (LLMs) that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences. Text-based GPT models are pre-trained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called \" hallucinations \". These can be reduced with RLHF and quality data, but the problem has been getting worse for reasoning systems. [ 124 ] Such systems are used in chatbots , which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text. [ 125 ] [ 126 ] Current models and services include ChatGPT , Claude , Gemini , Copilot , and Meta AI . [ 127 ] Multimodal GPT models can process different types of data ( modalities ) such as images, videos, sound, and text.

[ 137 ] It has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research. [ 137 ] [ 138 ] New AI tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways. For example, AlphaFold 2 (2021) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein . [ 139 ] In 2023, it was reported that AI-guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria. [ 140 ] In 2024, researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for Parkinson's disease drug treatments. Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping, or aggregation, of alpha-synuclein (the protein that characterises Parkinson's disease). They were able to speed up the initial screening process ten-fold and reduce the cost by a thousand-fold.

[ 222 ] Risks and harm Privacy and copyright Further information: Information privacy and Artificial intelligence and copyright Machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy , surveillance and copyright . AI-powered devices and services, such as virtual assistants and IoT products, continuously collect personal information, raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties. The loss of privacy is further exacerbated by AI's ability to process and combine vast amounts of data, potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency. Sensitive user data collected may include online activity records, geolocation data, video, or audio. [ 223 ] For example, in order to build speech recognition algorithms, Amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them. [ 224 ] Opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy . [ 225 ] AI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such as data aggregation , de-identification and differential privacy . [ 226 ] Since 2016, some privacy experts, such as Cynthia Dwork , have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness . Brian Christian wrote that experts have pivoted \"from the question of 'what they know' to the question of 'what they're doing with it'.\" [ 227 ] Generative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under the rationale of \" fair use \". Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include \"the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work\" and \"the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work\".

[ 230 ] In 2023, leading authors (including John Grisham and Jonathan Franzen ) sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI.

[ 237 ] [ 238 ] Power needs and environmental impacts See also: Environmental impacts of artificial intelligence In January 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released Electricity 2024, Analysis and Forecast to 2026 , forecasting electric power use. [ 239 ] This is the first IEA report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. The report states that power demand for these uses might double by 2026, with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole Japanese nation. [ 240 ] Prodigious power consumption by AI is responsible for the growth of fossil fuel use, and might delay closings of obsolete, carbon-emitting coal energy facilities. There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US, making large technology firms (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon) into voracious consumers of electric power. Projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search. The large firms are in haste to find power sources – from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. The tech firms argue that – in the long view – AI will be eventually kinder to the environment, but they need the energy now. AI makes the power grid more efficient and \"intelligent\", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to technology firms. [ 241 ] A 2024 Goldman Sachs Research Paper, AI Data Centers and the Coming US Power Demand Surge , found \"US power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation....\" and forecasts that, by 2030, US data centers will consume 8% of US power, as opposed to 3% in 2022, presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means. [ 242 ] Data centers' need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid. The Big Tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all. [ 243 ] In 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that big AI companies have begun negotiations with the US nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers. In March 2024 Amazon purchased a Pennsylvania nuclear-powered data center for US$650 million. [ 244 ] Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers. [ 245 ] In September 2024, Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation Energy to re-open the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100% of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years. Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission . If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power – enough for 800,000 homes – of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at US$1.6 billion and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act . [ 246 ] The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost US$2 billion to reopen the Palisades Nuclear reactor on Lake Michigan. Closed since 2022, the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO of Exelon who was responsible for Exelon's spinoff of Constellation. [ 247 ] After the last approval in September 2023, Taiwan suspended the approval of data centers north of Taoyuan with a capacity of more than 5 MW in 2024, due to power supply shortages.

[ 248 ] Although most nuclear plants in Japan have been shut down after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident , according to an October 2024 Bloomberg article in Japanese, cloud gaming services company Ubitus, in which Nvidia has a stake, is looking for land in Japan near a nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative AI. [ 249 ] Ubitus CEO Wesley Kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient, cheap and stable power for AI. [ 249 ] On 1 November 2024, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected an application submitted by Talen Energy for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station Susquehanna to Amazon's data center. [ 250 ] According to the Commission Chairman Willie L. Phillips , it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors. [ 250 ] In 2025, a report prepared by the International Energy Agency estimated the greenhouse gas emissions from the energy consumption of AI at 180 million tons. By 2035, these emissions could rise to 300–500 million tonnes depending on what measures will be taken. This is below 1.5% of the energy sector emissions. The emissions reduction potential of AI was estimated at 5% of the energy sector emissions, but rebound effects (for example if people switch from public transport to autonomous cars) can reduce it.

[ 266 ] [ 264 ] If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people (as it can in medicine , finance , recruitment , housing or policing ) then the algorithm may cause discrimination . [ 267 ] The field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases. On June 28, 2015, Google Photos 's new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as \"gorillas\" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people, [ 268 ] a problem called \"sample size disparity\". [ 269 ] Google \"fixed\" this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a \"gorilla\". Eight years later, in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon.

In 2016, Julia Angwin at ProPublica discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different—the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend. [ 271 ] In 2017, several researchers [ l ] showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data. [ 273 ] A program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as \"race\" or \"gender\"). The feature will correlate with other features (like \"address\", \"shopping history\" or \"first name\"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on \"race\" or \"gender\". [ 274 ] Moritz Hardt said \"the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn't work.\" [ 275 ] Criticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make \"predictions\" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions as recommendations , some of these \"recommendations\" will likely be racist. [ 276 ] Thus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

One broad category is distributive fairness , which focuses on the outcomes, often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities. Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative stereotypes or render certain groups invisible. Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases, but it may conflict with anti-discrimination laws . [ 263 ] At its 2022 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT 2022), the Association for Computing Machinery , in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings that recommend that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe, and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed.

There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as \"cancerous\", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale. [ 281 ] Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at \"low risk\" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading. [ 282 ] People who have been harmed by an algorithm's decision have a right to an explanation.

SHAP enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output. [ 286 ] LIME can locally approximate a model's outputs with a simpler, interpretable model. [ 287 ] Multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned. [ 288 ] Deconvolution , DeepDream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned, and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning.

[ 298 ] Technological unemployment Main articles: Workplace impact of artificial intelligence and Technological unemployment Economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment. [ 299 ] In the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that \"we're in uncharted territory\" with AI. [ 300 ] A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment , but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed . [ 301 ] Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimated 47% of U.S. jobs are at \"high risk\" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9% of U.S. jobs as \"high risk\". [ p ] [ 303 ] The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies. [ 299 ] In April 2023, it was reported that 70% of the jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence. [ 304 ] [ 305 ] Unlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist stated in 2015 that \"the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution\" is \"worth taking seriously\". [ 306 ] Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy. [ 307 ] From the early days of the development of artificial intelligence, there have been arguments, for example, those put forward by Joseph Weizenbaum , about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement. [ 308 ] Existential risk Main article: Existential risk from artificial intelligence It has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as physicist Stephen Hawking stated, \" spell the end of the human race \". [ 309 ] This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like \"self-awareness\" (or \"sentience\" or \"consciousness\") and becomes a malevolent character. [ q ] These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways. First, AI does not require human-like sentience to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of a paperclip maximizer ). [ 311 ] Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that \"you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead.\" [ 312 ] In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity's morality and values so that it is \"fundamentally on our side\". [ 313 ] Second, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like ideologies , law , government , money and the economy are built on language ; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive. [ 314 ] The opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI. [ 315 ] Personalities such as Stephen Hawking , Bill Gates , and Elon Musk , [ 316 ] as well as AI pioneers such as Yoshua Bengio , Stuart Russell , Demis Hassabis , and Sam Altman , have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI. In May 2023, Geoffrey Hinton announced his resignation from Google in order to be able to \"freely speak out about the risks of AI\" without \"considering how this impacts Google\". [ 317 ] He notably mentioned risks of an AI takeover , [ 318 ] and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes, establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI. [ 319 ] In 2023, many leading AI experts endorsed the joint statement that \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\". [ 320 ] Some other researchers were more optimistic. AI pioneer Jürgen Schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95% of all cases, AI research is about making \"human lives longer and healthier and easier.\" [ 321 ] While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, \"they can also be used against the bad actors.\" [ 322 ] [ 323 ] Andrew Ng also argued that \"it's a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI—and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests.\" [ 324 ] Yann LeCun \"scoffs at his peers' dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction.\" [ 325 ] In the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine.

[ 327 ] Ethical machines and alignment Main articles: Machine ethics , AI safety , Friendly artificial intelligence , Artificial moral agents , and Human Compatible Friendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. Eliezer Yudkowsky , who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk. [ 328 ] Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas. [ 329 ] The field of machine ethics is also called computational morality, [ 329 ] and was founded at an AAAI symposium in 2005. [ 330 ] Other approaches include Wendell Wallach 's \"artificial moral agents\" [ 331 ] and Stuart J. Russell 's three principles for developing provably beneficial machines. [ 332 ] Open source See also: Lists of open-source artificial intelligence software Active organizations in the AI open-source community include Hugging Face , [ 333 ] Google , [ 334 ] EleutherAI and Meta . [ 335 ] Various AI models, such as Llama 2 , Mistral or Stable Diffusion , have been made open-weight, [ 336 ] [ 337 ] meaning that their architecture and trained parameters (the \"weights\") are publicly available. Open-weight models can be freely fine-tuned , which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case. [ 338 ] Open-weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused. Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as objecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities (such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism ) and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed. They recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses. [ 339 ] Frameworks Artificial intelligence projects can be guided by ethical considerations during the design, development, and implementation of an AI system. An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework, developed by the Alan Turing Institute and based on the SUM values, outlines four main ethical dimensions, defined as follows: [ 340 ] [ 341 ] Respect the dignity of individual people Connect with other people sincerely, openly, and inclusively Care for the wellbeing of everyone Protect social values, justice, and the public interest Other developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the Asilomar Conference , the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, and the IEEE's Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative, among others; [ 342 ] however, these principles are not without criticism, especially regarding the people chosen to contribute to these frameworks. [ 343 ] Promotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of AI system design, development and implementation, and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists, product managers, data engineers, domain experts, and delivery managers. [ 344 ] The UK AI Safety Institute released in 2024 a testing toolset called 'Inspect' for AI safety evaluations available under an MIT open-source licence which is freely available on GitHub and can be improved with third-party packages. It can be used to evaluate AI models in a range of areas including core knowledge, ability to reason, and autonomous capabilities. [ 345 ] Regulation Main articles: Regulation of artificial intelligence , Regulation of algorithms , and AI safety The first global AI Safety Summit was held in the United Kingdom in November 2023 with a declaration calling for international cooperation. The regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI; it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms. [ 346 ] The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally. [ 347 ] According to AI Index at Stanford , the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone. [ 348 ] [ 349 ] Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI. [ 350 ] Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, U.S., and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia. [ 350 ] The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology. [ 350 ] Henry Kissinger , Eric Schmidt , and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI. [ 351 ] In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years. [ 352 ] In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, government officials and academics. [ 353 ] On 1 August 2024, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act entered into force, establishing the first comprehensive EU-wide AI regulation. [ 354 ] In 2024, the Council of Europe created the first international legally binding treaty on AI, called the \" Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law \". It was adopted by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other signatories. [ 355 ] In a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only 35% of Americans, agreed that \"products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks\". [ 348 ] A 2023 Reuters /Ipsos poll found that 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity. [ 356 ] In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35% of Americans thought it \"very important\", and an additional 41% thought it \"somewhat important\", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13% responding \"not very important\" and 8% responding \"not at all important\". [ 357 ] [ 358 ] In November 2023, the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks. [ 359 ] 28 countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of the summit, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence. [ 360 ] [ 361 ] In May 2024 at the AI Seoul Summit , 16 global AI tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of AI. [ 362 ] [ 363 ] History Main article: History of artificial intelligence For a chronological guide, see Timeline of artificial intelligence . In 2024, AI patents in China and the US numbered more than three-fourths of AI patents worldwide. [ 364 ] Though China had more AI patents, the US had 35% more patents per AI patent-applicant company than China. [ 364 ] The study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing 's theory of computation , which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning. [ 365 ] [ 366 ] This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics , information theory and neurobiology , led researchers to consider the possibility of building an \"electronic brain\". [ r ] They developed several areas of research that would become part of AI, [ 368 ] such as McCulloch and Pitts design for \"artificial neurons\" in 1943, [ 117 ] and Turing's influential 1950 paper ' Computing Machinery and Intelligence ', which introduced the Turing test and showed that \"machine intelligence\" was plausible. [ 369 ] [ 366 ] The field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956. [ s ] [ 6 ] The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s. [ t ] They and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\": [ u ] computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English. [ v ] [ 7 ] Artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and U.S. universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s. [ 366 ] Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field. [ 373 ] In 1965 Herbert Simon predicted, \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\". [ 374 ] In 1967 Marvin Minsky agreed, writing that \"within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved\". [ 375 ] They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 378 ] Minsky and Papert 's book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether. [ 379 ] The \" AI winter \", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed. [ 9 ] In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems , [ 380 ] a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research . [ 8 ] However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began. [ 10 ] Up to this point, most of AI's funding had gone to projects that used high-level symbols to represent mental objects like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception , robotics , learning and pattern recognition , [ 381 ] and began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches. [ 382 ] Rodney Brooks rejected \"representation\" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive. [ x ] Judea Pearl , Lotfi Zadeh , and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic. [ 87 ] [ 387 ] But the most important development was the revival of \" connectionism \", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others. [ 388 ] In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks. [ 389 ] AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems.

[ 391 ] However, several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or \"AGI\"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s. [ 68 ] Deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ y ] Deep learning's success was based on both hardware improvements ( faster computers , [ 393 ] graphics processing units , cloud computing [ 394 ] ) and access to large amounts of data [ 395 ] (including curated datasets, [ 394 ] such as ImageNet ). Deep learning's success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI. [ z ] The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019. [ 350 ] The number of Google searches for the term \"AI\" accelerated in 2022. In 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. The alignment problem became a serious field of academic study. [ 327 ] In the late 2010s and early 2020s, AGI companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest. In 2015, AlphaGo , developed by DeepMind , beat the world champion Go player . The program taught only the game's rules and developed a strategy by itself. GPT-3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of generating high-quality human-like text. [ 396 ] ChatGPT , launched on November 30, 2022, became the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months. [ 397 ] It marked what is widely regarded as AI's breakout year, bringing it into the public consciousness. [ 398 ] These programs, and others, inspired an aggressive AI boom , where large companies began investing billions of dollars in AI research. According to AI Impacts, about US$50 billion annually was invested in \"AI\" around 2022 in the U.S. alone and about 20% of the new U.S. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in \"AI\". [ 399 ] About 800,000 \"AI\"-related U.S. job openings existed in 2022. [ 400 ] According to PitchBook research, 22% of newly funded startups in 2024 claimed to be AI companies. [ 401 ] Philosophy Main article: Philosophy of artificial intelligence Philosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines. [ 402 ] Another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious, and the associated ethical implications. [ 403 ] Many other topics in philosophy are relevant to AI, such as epistemology and free will . [ 404 ] Rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of AI . [ 403 ] Defining artificial intelligence See also: Synthetic intelligence , Intelligent agent , Artificial mind , Virtual intelligence , and Dartmouth workshop Alan Turing wrote in 1950 \"I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?\" [ 405 ] He advised changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\". [ 405 ] He devised the Turing test , which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation. [ 369 ] Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\". Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks.\" [ 406 ] The Turing test can provide some evidence of intelligence, but it penalizes non-human intelligent behavior. [ 407 ] Russell and Norvig agree with Turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior, not internal structure. [ 1 ] However, they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans. \" Aeronautical engineering texts\", they wrote, \"do not define the goal of their field as making 'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons. ' \" [ 408 ] AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\". [ 409 ] McCarthy defines intelligence as \"the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world\". [ 410 ] Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky , similarly describes it as \"the ability to solve hard problems\". [ 411 ] The leading AI textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. [ 1 ] These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the \"intelligence\" of the machine—and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible. Another definition has been adopted by Google, [ 412 ] a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence. As a result of the many circulating definitions scholars have started to critically analyze and order the AI discourse itself [ 413 ] including discussing the many AI narratives and myths to be found within societal, political and academic discourses. [ 414 ] Similarly, in practice, some authors have suggested that the term 'AI' is often used too broadly and vaguely. This raises the question of where the line should be drawn between AI and classical algorithms, [ 415 ] with many companies during the early 2020s AI boom using the term as a marketing buzzword , often even if they did \"not actually use AI in a material way\". [ 416 ] There has been debate over whether large language models exhibit genuine intelligence or merely simulate it by imitating human text . [ 417 ] Evaluating approaches to AI No established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history. [ aa ] The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\"). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic , soft and narrow . ", "strategy": "semantic"}

Symbolic AI and its limits Symbolic AI (or \" GOFAI \") [ 419 ] simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis : \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\" [ 420 ] However, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning . Moravec's paradox is the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for AI, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult. [ 421 ] Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge. [ 422 ] Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him. [ ab ] [ 16 ] The issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias . Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence, [ 424 ] [ 425 ] in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI : it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches. Neat vs. scruffy Main article: Neats and scruffies \"Neats\" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic , optimization , or neural networks ). \"Scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s, [ 426 ] but eventually was seen as irrelevant. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 15 ] Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms , fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks. Narrow vs. general AI Main articles: Weak artificial intelligence and Artificial general intelligence AI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field's long-term goals. [ 427 ] [ 428 ] General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions.

This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence.

[ 431 ] Computationalism and functionalism Main articles: Computational theory of mind and Functionalism (philosophy of mind) Computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind–body problem . This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam . [ 432 ] Philosopher John Searle characterized this position as \" strong AI \": \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\" [ ac ] Searle challenges this claim with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind. [ 436 ] AI welfare and rights It is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient (has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree. [ 437 ] But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals. [ 438 ] [ 439 ] Sapience (a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment or self-awareness ) may provide another moral basis for AI rights. [ 438 ] Robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society. [ 440 ] In 2017, the European Union considered granting \"electronic personhood\" to some of the most capable AI systems. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities. [ 441 ] Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of human rights , and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios. They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part in society on their own. [ 442 ] [ 443 ] Progress in AI increased interest in the topic. Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny. They warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming , which could lead to large-scale suffering if sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited. [ 439 ] [ 438 ] Future Superintelligence and the singularity A superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind. [ 428 ] If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself . The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I. J. Good called an \" intelligence explosion \" and Vernor Vinge called a \" singularity \". [ 444 ] However, technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely, and typically follow an S-shaped curve , slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do. [ 445 ] Transhumanism Main article: Transhumanism Robot designer Hans Moravec , cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger . [ 446 ] Edward Fredkin argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution\", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler 's \" Darwin among the Machines \" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his 1998 book Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence . [ 447 ] In fiction Main article: Artificial intelligence in fiction The word \"robot\" itself was coined by Karel Čapek in his 1921 play R.U.R. , the title standing for \"Rossum's Universal Robots\". Thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity, [ 448 ] and have been a persistent theme in science fiction . [ 449 ] A common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein , where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke's and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000 , the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture. [ 450 ] Isaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many stories, most notably with the \" Multivac \" super-intelligent computer. Asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics; [ 451 ] while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity. [ 452 ] Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel , and thus to suffer. This appears in Karel Čapek 's R.U.R. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. [ 1 ] High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search ); recommendation systems (used by YouTube , Amazon , and Netflix ); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant , Siri , and Alexa ); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo ); generative and creative tools (e.g., language models and AI art ); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go ). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore .\" [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning , knowledge representation , planning , natural language processing , perception , and support for robotics . [ a ] To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization , formal logic , artificial neural networks , and methods based on statistics , operations research , and economics . [ b ] AI also draws upon psychology , linguistics , philosophy , neuroscience , and other fields. [ 4 ] Some companies, such as OpenAI , Google DeepMind and Meta , [ 5 ] aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI)—AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human. Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, [ 6 ] and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history , [ 7 ] [ 8 ] followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. [ 11 ] This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture . [ 12 ] In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom . Generative AI's ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms, which has raised ethical concerns about AI's long-term effects and potential existential risks , prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology. Goals The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research. [ a ] Reasoning and problem-solving Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions . [ 13 ] By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics . [ 14 ] Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow. [ 15 ] Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

Knowledge representation An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.

Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval, [ 18 ] scene interpretation, [ 19 ] clinical decision support, [ 20 ] knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases ), [ 21 ] and other areas. [ 22 ] A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge. [ 23 ] Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects; [ 24 ] situations, events, states, and time; [ 25 ] causes and effects; [ 26 ] knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know); [ 27 ] default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing); [ 28 ] and many other aspects and domains of knowledge. Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous); [ 29 ] and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally). [ 16 ] There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition , the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications. [ c ] Planning and decision-making An \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen. [ d ] [ 32 ] In automated planning , the agent has a specific goal. [ 33 ] In automated decision-making , the agent has preferences—there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \" utility \") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the \" expected utility \": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility. [ 34 ] In classical planning , the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be. [ 35 ] In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is \"unknown\" or \"unobservable\") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not \"deterministic\"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked. [ 36 ] In some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning ), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences. [ 37 ] Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions. [ 38 ] The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be. A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g., by iteration ), be heuristic , or it can be learned. [ 39 ] Game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents. [ 40 ] Learning Machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically. [ 41 ] It has been a part of AI from the beginning. [ e ] In supervised learning , the training data is labelled with the expected answers, while in unsupervised learning , the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data. There are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance. [ 44 ] Supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input). [ 45 ] In reinforcement learning , the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as \"good\". [ 46 ] Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem. [ 47 ] Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning. [ 48 ] Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity , by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization . [ 49 ] Natural language processing Natural language processing (NLP) allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages. [ 50 ] Specific problems include speech recognition , speech synthesis , machine translation , information extraction , information retrieval and question answering . [ 51 ] Early work, based on Noam Chomsky 's generative grammar and semantic networks , had difficulty with word-sense disambiguation [ f ] unless restricted to small domains called \" micro-worlds \" (due to the common sense knowledge problem [ 29 ] ). Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure. Modern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning), [ 52 ] transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism), [ 53 ] and others. [ 54 ] In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or \"GPT\") language models began to generate coherent text, [ 55 ] [ 56 ] and by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam , SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications. [ 57 ] Perception Machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar , sonar, radar, and tactile sensors ) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input. [ 58 ] The field includes speech recognition , [ 59 ] image classification , [ 60 ] facial recognition , object recognition , [ 61 ] object tracking , [ 62 ] and robotic perception . [ 63 ] Social intelligence Kismet , a robot head which was made in the 1990s; it is a machine that can recognize and simulate emotions. [ 64 ] Affective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human feeling, emotion, and mood . [ 65 ] For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction . However, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents. [ 66 ] Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis , wherein AI classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject. [ 67 ] General intelligence A machine with artificial general intelligence would be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence .

[ b ] Search and optimization AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions. [ 69 ] There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search . State space search State space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state. [ 70 ] For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis . [ 71 ] Simple exhaustive searches [ 72 ] are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers . The result is a search that is too slow or never completes. [ 15 ] \" Heuristics \" or \"rules of thumb\" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal. [ 73 ] Adversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves, looking for a winning position. [ 74 ] Local search Illustration of gradient descent for 3 different starting points; two parameters (represented by the plan coordinates) are adjusted in order to minimize the loss function (the height) Local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally. [ 75 ] Gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function . Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks , [ 76 ] through the backpropagation algorithm. Another type of local search is evolutionary computation , which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by \"mutating\" and \"recombining\" them, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation. [ 77 ] Distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking ) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails ). [ 78 ] Logic Formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation . ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 81 ] Deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement ( conclusion ) from other statements that are given and assumed to be true (the premises ). [ 82 ] Proofs can be structured as proof trees , in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules . Given a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms . In the case of Horn clauses , problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem. [ 83 ] In the more general case of the clausal form of first-order logic , resolution is a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved. [ 84 ] Inference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is undecidable , and therefore intractable . However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the logic programming language Prolog , is Turing complete . Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages. [ 85 ] Fuzzy logic assigns a \"degree of truth\" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true. [ 86 ] Non-monotonic logics , including logic programming with negation as failure , are designed to handle default reasoning . [ 28 ] Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains. Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning A simple Bayesian network , with the associated conditional probability tables Many problems in AI (including reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics. [ 87 ] Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory , decision analysis , [ 88 ] and information value theory . [ 89 ] These tools include models such as Markov decision processes , [ 90 ] dynamic decision networks , [ 91 ] game theory and mechanism design . [ 92 ] Bayesian networks [ 93 ] are a tool that can be used for reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm), [ g ] [ 95 ] learning (using the expectation–maximization algorithm ), [ h ] [ 97 ] planning (using decision networks ) [ 98 ] and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks ). [ 91 ] Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data, thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters ). [ 91 ] Expectation–maximization clustering of Old Faithful eruption data starts from a random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption. Classifiers and statistical learning methods The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g., \"if shiny then diamond\"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g., \"if diamond then pick up\"), on the other hand.

They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning . Each pattern (also called an \" observation \") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set . When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience. [ 45 ] There are many kinds of classifiers in use. [ 100 ] The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm. [ 101 ] K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s. [ 102 ] The naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\" [ 103 ] at Google, due in part to its scalability. [ 104 ] Neural networks are also used as classifiers. [ 105 ] Artificial neural networks A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain . An artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons , which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers. [ 105 ] Learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm. [ 106 ] Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function. [ 107 ] In feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction. [ 108 ] The term perceptron typically refers to a single-layer neural network. [ 109 ] In contrast, deep learning uses many layers. [ 110 ] Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events. Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) are recurrent neural networks that better preserve longterm dependencies and are less sensitive to the vanishing gradient problem . [ 111 ] Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use layers of kernels to more efficiently process local patterns. This local processing is especially important in image processing , where the early CNN layers typically identify simple local patterns such as edges and curves, with subsequent layers detecting more complex patterns like textures, and eventually whole objects. [ 112 ] Deep learning Deep learning is a subset of machine learning , which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence. [ 113 ] Deep learning uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs. [ 110 ] The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing , lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces. [ 114 ] Deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision , speech recognition , natural language processing , image classification , [ 115 ] and others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2021. [ 116 ] The sudden success of deep learning in 2012–2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s) [ i ] but because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs ) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet . [ j ] GPT Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models (LLMs) that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences. Text-based GPT models are pre-trained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called \" hallucinations \". These can be reduced with RLHF and quality data, but the problem has been getting worse for reasoning systems. [ 124 ] Such systems are used in chatbots , which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text. [ 125 ] [ 126 ] Current models and services include ChatGPT , Claude , Gemini , Copilot , and Meta AI . [ 127 ] Multimodal GPT models can process different types of data ( modalities ) such as images, videos, sound, and text.

[ 137 ] It has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research. [ 137 ] [ 138 ] New AI tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways. For example, AlphaFold 2 (2021) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein . [ 139 ] In 2023, it was reported that AI-guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria.

In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported having incorporated \"AI\" in some offerings or processes. [ 211 ] A few examples are energy storage , medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions, foreign policy , or supply chain management. AI applications for evacuation and disaster management are growing. AI has been used to investigate patterns in large-scale and small-scale evacuations using historical data from GPS, videos or social media. Furthermore, AI can provide real-time information on the evacuation conditions. [ 212 ] [ 213 ] [ 214 ] In agriculture, AI has helped farmers to increase yield and identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments. Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct predictive analytics , classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water. Artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for \"classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights.\" For example, it is used for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy.

[ 215 ] Ethics Main article: Ethics of artificial intelligence Street art in Tel Aviv [ 216 ] [ 217 ] AI has potential benefits and potential risks. [ 218 ] AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: Demis Hassabis of DeepMind hopes to \"solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else\". [ 219 ] However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified. [ 220 ] [ 221 ] In-production systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their AI training processes, especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning. [ 222 ] Risks and harm Privacy and copyright Further information: Information privacy and Artificial intelligence and copyright Machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy , surveillance and copyright . AI-powered devices and services, such as virtual assistants and IoT products, continuously collect personal information, raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties. The loss of privacy is further exacerbated by AI's ability to process and combine vast amounts of data, potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency. Sensitive user data collected may include online activity records, geolocation data, video, or audio. [ 223 ] For example, in order to build speech recognition algorithms, Amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them. [ 224 ] Opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy . [ 225 ] AI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such as data aggregation , de-identification and differential privacy . [ 226 ] Since 2016, some privacy experts, such as Cynthia Dwork , have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness . Brian Christian wrote that experts have pivoted \"from the question of 'what they know' to the question of 'what they're doing with it'.\" [ 227 ] Generative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under the rationale of \" fair use \". Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include \"the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work\" and \"the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work\". [ 228 ] [ 229 ] Website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a \" robots.txt \" file. [ 230 ] In 2023, leading authors (including John Grisham and Jonathan Franzen ) sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI. [ 231 ] [ 232 ] Another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by AI to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors.

[ 237 ] [ 238 ] Power needs and environmental impacts See also: Environmental impacts of artificial intelligence In January 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released Electricity 2024, Analysis and Forecast to 2026 , forecasting electric power use. [ 239 ] This is the first IEA report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. The report states that power demand for these uses might double by 2026, with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole Japanese nation. [ 240 ] Prodigious power consumption by AI is responsible for the growth of fossil fuel use, and might delay closings of obsolete, carbon-emitting coal energy facilities. There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US, making large technology firms (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon) into voracious consumers of electric power. Projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search. The large firms are in haste to find power sources – from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. The tech firms argue that – in the long view – AI will be eventually kinder to the environment, but they need the energy now. AI makes the power grid more efficient and \"intelligent\", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to technology firms. [ 241 ] A 2024 Goldman Sachs Research Paper, AI Data Centers and the Coming US Power Demand Surge , found \"US power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation....\" and forecasts that, by 2030, US data centers will consume 8% of US power, as opposed to 3% in 2022, presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means. [ 242 ] Data centers' need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid. The Big Tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all. [ 243 ] In 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that big AI companies have begun negotiations with the US nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers. In March 2024 Amazon purchased a Pennsylvania nuclear-powered data center for US$650 million. [ 244 ] Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers. [ 245 ] In September 2024, Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation Energy to re-open the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100% of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years. Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission . If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power – enough for 800,000 homes – of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at US$1.6 billion and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act . [ 246 ] The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost US$2 billion to reopen the Palisades Nuclear reactor on Lake Michigan. Closed since 2022, the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO of Exelon who was responsible for Exelon's spinoff of Constellation.

[ 248 ] Although most nuclear plants in Japan have been shut down after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident , according to an October 2024 Bloomberg article in Japanese, cloud gaming services company Ubitus, in which Nvidia has a stake, is looking for land in Japan near a nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative AI. [ 249 ] Ubitus CEO Wesley Kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient, cheap and stable power for AI. [ 249 ] On 1 November 2024, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected an application submitted by Talen Energy for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station Susquehanna to Amazon's data center. [ 250 ] According to the Commission Chairman Willie L. Phillips , it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors. [ 250 ] In 2025, a report prepared by the International Energy Agency estimated the greenhouse gas emissions from the energy consumption of AI at 180 million tons. By 2035, these emissions could rise to 300–500 million tonnes depending on what measures will be taken. This is below 1.5% of the energy sector emissions. The emissions reduction potential of AI was estimated at 5% of the energy sector emissions, but rebound effects (for example if people switch from public transport to autonomous cars) can reduce it.

[ 267 ] The field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases. On June 28, 2015, Google Photos 's new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as \"gorillas\" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people, [ 268 ] a problem called \"sample size disparity\".

[ 271 ] In 2017, several researchers [ l ] showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data. [ 273 ] A program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as \"race\" or \"gender\"). The feature will correlate with other features (like \"address\", \"shopping history\" or \"first name\"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on \"race\" or \"gender\". [ 274 ] Moritz Hardt said \"the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn't work.\" [ 275 ] Criticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make \"predictions\" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions as recommendations , some of these \"recommendations\" will likely be racist.

Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases, but it may conflict with anti-discrimination laws .

[ 281 ] Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at \"low risk\" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data.

[ 298 ] Technological unemployment Main articles: Workplace impact of artificial intelligence and Technological unemployment Economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment. [ 299 ] In the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that \"we're in uncharted territory\" with AI. [ 300 ] A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment , but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed . [ 301 ] Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimated 47% of U.S. jobs are at \"high risk\" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9% of U.S. jobs as \"high risk\". [ p ] [ 303 ] The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies. [ 299 ] In April 2023, it was reported that 70% of the jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence. [ 304 ] [ 305 ] Unlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist stated in 2015 that \"the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution\" is \"worth taking seriously\". [ 306 ] Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy. [ 307 ] From the early days of the development of artificial intelligence, there have been arguments, for example, those put forward by Joseph Weizenbaum , about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement. [ 308 ] Existential risk Main article: Existential risk from artificial intelligence It has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as physicist Stephen Hawking stated, \" spell the end of the human race \". [ 309 ] This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like \"self-awareness\" (or \"sentience\" or \"consciousness\") and becomes a malevolent character. [ q ] These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways. First, AI does not require human-like sentience to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of a paperclip maximizer ). [ 311 ] Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that \"you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead.\" [ 312 ] In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity's morality and values so that it is \"fundamentally on our side\". [ 313 ] Second, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like ideologies , law , government , money and the economy are built on language ; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive. [ 314 ] The opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI. [ 315 ] Personalities such as Stephen Hawking , Bill Gates , and Elon Musk , [ 316 ] as well as AI pioneers such as Yoshua Bengio , Stuart Russell , Demis Hassabis , and Sam Altman , have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI. In May 2023, Geoffrey Hinton announced his resignation from Google in order to be able to \"freely speak out about the risks of AI\" without \"considering how this impacts Google\". [ 317 ] He notably mentioned risks of an AI takeover , [ 318 ] and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes, establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI. [ 319 ] In 2023, many leading AI experts endorsed the joint statement that \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\". [ 320 ] Some other researchers were more optimistic. AI pioneer Jürgen Schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95% of all cases, AI research is about making \"human lives longer and healthier and easier.\" [ 321 ] While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, \"they can also be used against the bad actors.\" [ 322 ] [ 323 ] Andrew Ng also argued that \"it's a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI—and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests.\" [ 324 ] Yann LeCun \"scoffs at his peers' dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction.\" [ 325 ] In the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine.

Eliezer Yudkowsky , who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk. [ 328 ] Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas. [ 329 ] The field of machine ethics is also called computational morality, [ 329 ] and was founded at an AAAI symposium in 2005. [ 330 ] Other approaches include Wendell Wallach 's \"artificial moral agents\" [ 331 ] and Stuart J. Russell 's three principles for developing provably beneficial machines. [ 332 ] Open source See also: Lists of open-source artificial intelligence software Active organizations in the AI open-source community include Hugging Face , [ 333 ] Google , [ 334 ] EleutherAI and Meta . [ 335 ] Various AI models, such as Llama 2 , Mistral or Stable Diffusion , have been made open-weight, [ 336 ] [ 337 ] meaning that their architecture and trained parameters (the \"weights\") are publicly available. Open-weight models can be freely fine-tuned , which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case. [ 338 ] Open-weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused. Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as objecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities (such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism ) and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed. They recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses. [ 339 ] Frameworks Artificial intelligence projects can be guided by ethical considerations during the design, development, and implementation of an AI system. An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework, developed by the Alan Turing Institute and based on the SUM values, outlines four main ethical dimensions, defined as follows: [ 340 ] [ 341 ] Respect the dignity of individual people Connect with other people sincerely, openly, and inclusively Care for the wellbeing of everyone Protect social values, justice, and the public interest Other developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the Asilomar Conference , the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, and the IEEE's Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative, among others; [ 342 ] however, these principles are not without criticism, especially regarding the people chosen to contribute to these frameworks. [ 343 ] Promotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of AI system design, development and implementation, and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists, product managers, data engineers, domain experts, and delivery managers. [ 344 ] The UK AI Safety Institute released in 2024 a testing toolset called 'Inspect' for AI safety evaluations available under an MIT open-source licence which is freely available on GitHub and can be improved with third-party packages. It can be used to evaluate AI models in a range of areas including core knowledge, ability to reason, and autonomous capabilities. [ 345 ] Regulation Main articles: Regulation of artificial intelligence , Regulation of algorithms , and AI safety The first global AI Safety Summit was held in the United Kingdom in November 2023 with a declaration calling for international cooperation. The regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI; it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms. [ 346 ] The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally. [ 347 ] According to AI Index at Stanford , the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone. [ 348 ] [ 349 ] Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI. [ 350 ] Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, U.S., and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia. [ 350 ] The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology. [ 350 ] Henry Kissinger , Eric Schmidt , and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI. [ 351 ] In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years. [ 352 ] In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, government officials and academics. [ 353 ] On 1 August 2024, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act entered into force, establishing the first comprehensive EU-wide AI regulation. [ 354 ] In 2024, the Council of Europe created the first international legally binding treaty on AI, called the \" Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law \". It was adopted by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other signatories. [ 355 ] In a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only 35% of Americans, agreed that \"products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks\". [ 348 ] A 2023 Reuters /Ipsos poll found that 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity. [ 356 ] In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35% of Americans thought it \"very important\", and an additional 41% thought it \"somewhat important\", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13% responding \"not very important\" and 8% responding \"not at all important\". [ 357 ] [ 358 ] In November 2023, the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks. [ 359 ] 28 countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of the summit, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence. [ 360 ] [ 361 ] In May 2024 at the AI Seoul Summit , 16 global AI tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of AI. [ 362 ] [ 363 ] History Main article: History of artificial intelligence For a chronological guide, see Timeline of artificial intelligence . In 2024, AI patents in China and the US numbered more than three-fourths of AI patents worldwide. [ 364 ] Though China had more AI patents, the US had 35% more patents per AI patent-applicant company than China. [ 364 ] The study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing 's theory of computation , which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning. [ 365 ] [ 366 ] This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics , information theory and neurobiology , led researchers to consider the possibility of building an \"electronic brain\". [ r ] They developed several areas of research that would become part of AI, [ 368 ] such as McCulloch and Pitts design for \"artificial neurons\" in 1943, [ 117 ] and Turing's influential 1950 paper ' Computing Machinery and Intelligence ', which introduced the Turing test and showed that \"machine intelligence\" was plausible. [ 369 ] [ 366 ] The field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956. [ s ] [ 6 ] The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s. [ t ] They and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\": [ u ] computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English. [ v ] [ 7 ] Artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and U.S. universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s. [ 366 ] Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field. [ 373 ] In 1965 Herbert Simon predicted, \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\". [ 374 ] In 1967 Marvin Minsky agreed, writing that \"within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved\". [ 375 ] They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 378 ] Minsky and Papert 's book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether. [ 379 ] The \" AI winter \", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed. [ 9 ] In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems , [ 380 ] a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research . [ 8 ] However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began. [ 10 ] Up to this point, most of AI's funding had gone to projects that used high-level symbols to represent mental objects like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception , robotics , learning and pattern recognition , [ 381 ] and began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches. [ 382 ] Rodney Brooks rejected \"representation\" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive. [ x ] Judea Pearl , Lotfi Zadeh , and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic. [ 87 ] [ 387 ] But the most important development was the revival of \" connectionism \", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others. [ 388 ] In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks. [ 389 ] AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems.

[ 390 ] By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as \"artificial intelligence\" (a tendency known as the AI effect ). [ 391 ] However, several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or \"AGI\"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s. [ 68 ] Deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ y ] Deep learning's success was based on both hardware improvements ( faster computers , [ 393 ] graphics processing units , cloud computing [ 394 ] ) and access to large amounts of data [ 395 ] (including curated datasets, [ 394 ] such as ImageNet ). Deep learning's success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI. [ z ] The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019. [ 350 ] The number of Google searches for the term \"AI\" accelerated in 2022. In 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. The alignment problem became a serious field of academic study. [ 327 ] In the late 2010s and early 2020s, AGI companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest. In 2015, AlphaGo , developed by DeepMind , beat the world champion Go player . The program taught only the game's rules and developed a strategy by itself. GPT-3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of generating high-quality human-like text. [ 396 ] ChatGPT , launched on November 30, 2022, became the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months. [ 397 ] It marked what is widely regarded as AI's breakout year, bringing it into the public consciousness. [ 398 ] These programs, and others, inspired an aggressive AI boom , where large companies began investing billions of dollars in AI research. According to AI Impacts, about US$50 billion annually was invested in \"AI\" around 2022 in the U.S. alone and about 20% of the new U.S. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in \"AI\". [ 399 ] About 800,000 \"AI\"-related U.S. job openings existed in 2022. [ 400 ] According to PitchBook research, 22% of newly funded startups in 2024 claimed to be AI companies. [ 401 ] Philosophy Main article: Philosophy of artificial intelligence Philosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines. [ 402 ] Another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious, and the associated ethical implications. [ 403 ] Many other topics in philosophy are relevant to AI, such as epistemology and free will . [ 404 ] Rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of AI . [ 403 ] Defining artificial intelligence See also: Synthetic intelligence , Intelligent agent , Artificial mind , Virtual intelligence , and Dartmouth workshop Alan Turing wrote in 1950 \"I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?\" [ 405 ] He advised changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\". [ 405 ] He devised the Turing test , which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation. [ 369 ] Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\". Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks.\" [ 406 ] The Turing test can provide some evidence of intelligence, but it penalizes non-human intelligent behavior. [ 407 ] Russell and Norvig agree with Turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior, not internal structure. [ 1 ] However, they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans. \" Aeronautical engineering texts\", they wrote, \"do not define the goal of their field as making 'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons. ' \" [ 408 ] AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\". [ 409 ] McCarthy defines intelligence as \"the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world\". [ 410 ] Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky , similarly describes it as \"the ability to solve hard problems\". [ 411 ] The leading AI textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. [ 1 ] These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the \"intelligence\" of the machine—and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible. Another definition has been adopted by Google, [ 412 ] a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence. As a result of the many circulating definitions scholars have started to critically analyze and order the AI discourse itself [ 413 ] including discussing the many AI narratives and myths to be found within societal, political and academic discourses. [ 414 ] Similarly, in practice, some authors have suggested that the term 'AI' is often used too broadly and vaguely. This raises the question of where the line should be drawn between AI and classical algorithms, [ 415 ] with many companies during the early 2020s AI boom using the term as a marketing buzzword , often even if they did \"not actually use AI in a material way\". [ 416 ] There has been debate over whether large language models exhibit genuine intelligence or merely simulate it by imitating human text . [ 417 ] Evaluating approaches to AI No established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history. [ aa ] The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\"). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic , soft and narrow . ", "strategy": "semantic"}

Symbolic AI and its limits Symbolic AI (or \" GOFAI \") [ 419 ] simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis : \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\" [ 420 ] However, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning . Moravec's paradox is the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for AI, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult. [ 421 ] Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge. [ 422 ] Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him. [ ab ] [ 16 ] The issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias . Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence, [ 424 ] [ 425 ] in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI : it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches. Neat vs. scruffy Main article: Neats and scruffies \"Neats\" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic , optimization , or neural networks ). \"Scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s, [ 426 ] but eventually was seen as irrelevant. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 15 ] Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms , fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks. Narrow vs. general AI Main articles: Weak artificial intelligence and Artificial general intelligence AI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field's long-term goals. [ 427 ] [ 428 ] General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively. Machine consciousness, sentience, and mind Main articles: Philosophy of artificial intelligence and Artificial consciousness There is no settled consensus in philosophy of mind on whether a machine can have a mind , consciousness and mental states in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. Russell and Norvig add that \"[t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on.\" [ 429 ] However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind.

The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett's consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion).

[ 431 ] Computationalism and functionalism Main articles: Computational theory of mind and Functionalism (philosophy of mind) Computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind–body problem . This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam . [ 432 ] Philosopher John Searle characterized this position as \" strong AI \": \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\" [ ac ] Searle challenges this claim with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind. [ 436 ] AI welfare and rights It is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient (has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree. [ 437 ] But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals. [ 438 ] [ 439 ] Sapience (a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment or self-awareness ) may provide another moral basis for AI rights. [ 438 ] Robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society. [ 440 ] In 2017, the European Union considered granting \"electronic personhood\" to some of the most capable AI systems. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities. [ 441 ] Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of human rights , and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios. They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part in society on their own. [ 442 ] [ 443 ] Progress in AI increased interest in the topic. Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny. They warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming , which could lead to large-scale suffering if sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited. [ 439 ] [ 438 ] Future Superintelligence and the singularity A superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind. [ 428 ] If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself . The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I. J. Good called an \" intelligence explosion \" and Vernor Vinge called a \" singularity \". [ 444 ] However, technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely, and typically follow an S-shaped curve , slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do. [ 445 ] Transhumanism Main article: Transhumanism Robot designer Hans Moravec , cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger . [ 446 ] Edward Fredkin argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution\", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler 's \" Darwin among the Machines \" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his 1998 book Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence . [ 447 ] In fiction Main article: Artificial intelligence in fiction The word \"robot\" itself was coined by Karel Čapek in his 1921 play R.U.R. , the title standing for \"Rossum's Universal Robots\". Thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity, [ 448 ] and have been a persistent theme in science fiction . [ 449 ] A common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein , where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke's and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000 , the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture. [ 450 ] Isaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many stories, most notably with the \" Multivac \" super-intelligent computer. Asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics; [ 451 ] while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity. [ 452 ] Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel , and thus to suffer. This appears in Karel Čapek 's R.U.R. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. [ 1 ] High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search ); recommendation systems (used by YouTube , Amazon , and Netflix ); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant , Siri , and Alexa ); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo ); generative and creative tools (e.g., language models and AI art ); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go ). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore .\" [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning , knowledge representation , planning , natural language processing , perception , and support for robotics . [ a ] To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization , formal logic , artificial neural networks , and methods based on statistics , operations research , and economics . [ b ] AI also draws upon psychology , linguistics , philosophy , neuroscience , and other fields. [ 4 ] Some companies, such as OpenAI , Google DeepMind and Meta , [ 5 ] aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI)—AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human. Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, [ 6 ] and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history , [ 7 ] [ 8 ] followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. [ 11 ] This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture . [ 12 ] In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom . Generative AI's ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms, which has raised ethical concerns about AI's long-term effects and potential existential risks , prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology. Goals The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research. [ a ] Reasoning and problem-solving Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions . [ 13 ] By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics . [ 14 ] Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow. [ 15 ] Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

Knowledge representation An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts. Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering [ 17 ] allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval, [ 18 ] scene interpretation, [ 19 ] clinical decision support, [ 20 ] knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases ), [ 21 ] and other areas. [ 22 ] A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge. [ 23 ] Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects; [ 24 ] situations, events, states, and time; [ 25 ] causes and effects; [ 26 ] knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know); [ 27 ] default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing); [ 28 ] and many other aspects and domains of knowledge. Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous); [ 29 ] and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally). [ 16 ] There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition , the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications. [ c ] Planning and decision-making An \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen. [ d ] [ 32 ] In automated planning , the agent has a specific goal. [ 33 ] In automated decision-making , the agent has preferences—there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \" utility \") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the \" expected utility \": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility. [ 34 ] In classical planning , the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be. [ 35 ] In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is \"unknown\" or \"unobservable\") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not \"deterministic\"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked. [ 36 ] In some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning ), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences. [ 37 ] Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions. [ 38 ] The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be. A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g., by iteration ), be heuristic , or it can be learned. [ 39 ] Game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents. [ 40 ] Learning Machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically. [ 41 ] It has been a part of AI from the beginning. [ e ] In supervised learning , the training data is labelled with the expected answers, while in unsupervised learning , the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data. There are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance. [ 44 ] Supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input). [ 45 ] In reinforcement learning , the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as \"good\". [ 46 ] Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem. [ 47 ] Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning. [ 48 ] Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity , by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization . [ 49 ] Natural language processing Natural language processing (NLP) allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages. [ 50 ] Specific problems include speech recognition , speech synthesis , machine translation , information extraction , information retrieval and question answering . [ 51 ] Early work, based on Noam Chomsky 's generative grammar and semantic networks , had difficulty with word-sense disambiguation [ f ] unless restricted to small domains called \" micro-worlds \" (due to the common sense knowledge problem [ 29 ] ). Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure. Modern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning), [ 52 ] transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism), [ 53 ] and others. [ 54 ] In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or \"GPT\") language models began to generate coherent text, [ 55 ] [ 56 ] and by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam , SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications. [ 57 ] Perception Machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar , sonar, radar, and tactile sensors ) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input. [ 58 ] The field includes speech recognition , [ 59 ] image classification , [ 60 ] facial recognition , object recognition , [ 61 ] object tracking , [ 62 ] and robotic perception . [ 63 ] Social intelligence Kismet , a robot head which was made in the 1990s; it is a machine that can recognize and simulate emotions. [ 64 ] Affective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human feeling, emotion, and mood . [ 65 ] For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction . However, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents. [ 66 ] Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis , wherein AI classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject. [ 67 ] General intelligence A machine with artificial general intelligence would be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence .

[ b ] Search and optimization AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions. [ 69 ] There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search . State space search State space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state. [ 70 ] For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis . [ 71 ] Simple exhaustive searches [ 72 ] are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers . The result is a search that is too slow or never completes. [ 15 ] \" Heuristics \" or \"rules of thumb\" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal. [ 73 ] Adversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves, looking for a winning position. [ 74 ] Local search Illustration of gradient descent for 3 different starting points; two parameters (represented by the plan coordinates) are adjusted in order to minimize the loss function (the height) Local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally. [ 75 ] Gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function . Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks , [ 76 ] through the backpropagation algorithm. Another type of local search is evolutionary computation , which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by \"mutating\" and \"recombining\" them, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation. [ 77 ] Distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking ) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails ). [ 78 ] Logic Formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation . ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 81 ] Deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement ( conclusion ) from other statements that are given and assumed to be true (the premises ). [ 82 ] Proofs can be structured as proof trees , in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules . Given a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms . In the case of Horn clauses , problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem. [ 83 ] In the more general case of the clausal form of first-order logic , resolution is a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved. [ 84 ] Inference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is undecidable , and therefore intractable . However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the logic programming language Prolog , is Turing complete . Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages. [ 85 ] Fuzzy logic assigns a \"degree of truth\" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true. [ 86 ] Non-monotonic logics , including logic programming with negation as failure , are designed to handle default reasoning . [ 28 ] Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains. Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning A simple Bayesian network , with the associated conditional probability tables Many problems in AI (including reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics. [ 87 ] Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory , decision analysis , [ 88 ] and information value theory . [ 89 ] These tools include models such as Markov decision processes , [ 90 ] dynamic decision networks , [ 91 ] game theory and mechanism design . [ 92 ] Bayesian networks [ 93 ] are a tool that can be used for reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm), [ g ] [ 95 ] learning (using the expectation–maximization algorithm ), [ h ] [ 97 ] planning (using decision networks ) [ 98 ] and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks ). [ 91 ] Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data, thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters ). [ 91 ] Expectation–maximization clustering of Old Faithful eruption data starts from a random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption. Classifiers and statistical learning methods The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g., \"if shiny then diamond\"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g., \"if diamond then pick up\"), on the other hand.

They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning . Each pattern (also called an \" observation \") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set . When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience. [ 45 ] There are many kinds of classifiers in use. [ 100 ] The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm. [ 101 ] K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s. [ 102 ] The naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\" [ 103 ] at Google, due in part to its scalability. [ 104 ] Neural networks are also used as classifiers. [ 105 ] Artificial neural networks A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain . An artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons , which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers. [ 105 ] Learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm. [ 106 ] Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function. [ 107 ] In feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction. [ 108 ] The term perceptron typically refers to a single-layer neural network. [ 109 ] In contrast, deep learning uses many layers. [ 110 ] Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events. Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) are recurrent neural networks that better preserve longterm dependencies and are less sensitive to the vanishing gradient problem . [ 111 ] Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use layers of kernels to more efficiently process local patterns. This local processing is especially important in image processing , where the early CNN layers typically identify simple local patterns such as edges and curves, with subsequent layers detecting more complex patterns like textures, and eventually whole objects. [ 112 ] Deep learning Deep learning is a subset of machine learning , which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence. [ 113 ] Deep learning uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs. [ 110 ] The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing , lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces. [ 114 ] Deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision , speech recognition , natural language processing , image classification , [ 115 ] and others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2021. [ 116 ] The sudden success of deep learning in 2012–2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s) [ i ] but because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs ) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet . [ j ] GPT Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models (LLMs) that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences. Text-based GPT models are pre-trained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called \" hallucinations \". These can be reduced with RLHF and quality data, but the problem has been getting worse for reasoning systems. [ 124 ] Such systems are used in chatbots , which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text. [ 125 ] [ 126 ] Current models and services include ChatGPT , Claude , Gemini , Copilot , and Meta AI . [ 127 ] Multimodal GPT models can process different types of data ( modalities ) such as images, videos, sound, and text.

Improvements in GPUs have been even faster, [ 132 ] a trend sometimes called Huang's law , [ 133 ] named after Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang .

Health and medicine Main article: Artificial intelligence in healthcare The application of AI in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life. [ 134 ] Through the lens of the Hippocratic Oath , medical professionals are ethically compelled to use AI, if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients. [ 135 ] [ 136 ] For medical research, AI is an important tool for processing and integrating big data . This is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication. [ 137 ] It has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research. [ 137 ] [ 138 ] New AI tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways. For example, AlphaFold 2 (2021) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein . [ 139 ] In 2023, it was reported that AI-guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria. [ 140 ] In 2024, researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for Parkinson's disease drug treatments. Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping, or aggregation, of alpha-synuclein (the protein that characterises Parkinson's disease). They were able to speed up the initial screening process ten-fold and reduce the cost by a thousand-fold.

[ 167 ] Research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles . [ 166 ] AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition , coordination and deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires between networked combat vehicles, both human-operated and autonomous . [ 167 ] AI has been used in military operations in Iraq, Syria, Israel and Ukraine. [ 166 ] [ 168 ] [ 169 ] [ 170 ] Generative AI Vincent van Gogh in watercolour created by generative AI software These paragraphs are an excerpt from Generative artificial intelligence . [ edit ] Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI, GenAI, [ 171 ] or GAI) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to produce text, images, videos, or other forms of data. [ 172 ] [ 173 ] [ 174 ] These models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data and use them to produce new data [ 175 ] [ 176 ] based on the input, which often comes in the form of natural language prompts . [ 177 ] [ 178 ] Generative AI tools have become more common since the AI boom in the 2020s. This boom was made possible by improvements in transformer -based deep neural networks , particularly large language models (LLMs). Major tools include chatbots such as ChatGPT , Copilot , Gemini , Claude , Grok , and DeepSeek ; text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion , Midjourney , and DALL-E ; and text-to-video models such as Veo and Sora . [ 179 ] [ 180 ] [ 181 ] [ 182 ] [ 183 ] Technology companies developing generative AI include OpenAI , xAI , Anthropic , Meta AI , Microsoft , Google , DeepSeek , and Baidu . [ 177 ] [ 184 ] [ 185 ] Generative AI is used across many industries, including software development, [ 186 ] healthcare, [ 187 ] finance, [ 188 ] entertainment, [ 189 ] customer service, [ 190 ] sales and marketing, [ 191 ] art, writing, [ 192 ] fashion, [ 193 ] and product design. [ 194 ] The production of generative AI systems requires large scale data centers using specialized chips which require a lot of electricity for processing and water for cooling. [ 195 ] Agents Main article: Agentic AI AI agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents. AI agents are used in various applications, including virtual assistants , chatbots , autonomous vehicles , game-playing systems , and industrial robotics . AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities. In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution. Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 200 ] For safety, Copilot uses AI-based classifiers and filters to reduce potentially harmful content. [ 201 ] Google officially pushed its AI Search at its Google I/O event on May 20, 2025. [ 202 ] It keeps people looking at Google instead of clicking on a search result. AI Overviews uses Gemini 2.5 to provide contextual answers to user queries based on web content. [ 203 ] Sexuality Applications of AI in this domain include AI-enabled menstruation and fertility trackers that analyze user data to offer predictions, [ 204 ] AI-integrated sex toys (e.g., teledildonics ), [ 205 ] AI-generated sexual education content, [ 206 ] and AI agents that simulate sexual and romantic partners (e.g., Replika ). [ 207 ] AI is also used for the production of non-consensual deepfake pornography , raising significant ethical and legal concerns. [ 208 ] AI technologies have also been used to attempt to identify online gender-based violence and online sexual grooming of minors. [ 209 ] [ 210 ] Other industry-specific tasks There are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported having incorporated \"AI\" in some offerings or processes. [ 211 ] A few examples are energy storage , medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions, foreign policy , or supply chain management. AI applications for evacuation and disaster management are growing. AI has been used to investigate patterns in large-scale and small-scale evacuations using historical data from GPS, videos or social media. Furthermore, AI can provide real-time information on the evacuation conditions. [ 212 ] [ 213 ] [ 214 ] In agriculture, AI has helped farmers to increase yield and identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments. Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct predictive analytics , classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water. Artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for \"classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights.\" For example, it is used for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy.

[ 215 ] Ethics Main article: Ethics of artificial intelligence Street art in Tel Aviv [ 216 ] [ 217 ] AI has potential benefits and potential risks. [ 218 ] AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: Demis Hassabis of DeepMind hopes to \"solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else\". [ 219 ] However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified. [ 220 ] [ 221 ] In-production systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their AI training processes, especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning. [ 222 ] Risks and harm Privacy and copyright Further information: Information privacy and Artificial intelligence and copyright Machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy , surveillance and copyright . AI-powered devices and services, such as virtual assistants and IoT products, continuously collect personal information, raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties. The loss of privacy is further exacerbated by AI's ability to process and combine vast amounts of data, potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency. Sensitive user data collected may include online activity records, geolocation data, video, or audio. [ 223 ] For example, in order to build speech recognition algorithms, Amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them. [ 224 ] Opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy . [ 225 ] AI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such as data aggregation , de-identification and differential privacy . [ 226 ] Since 2016, some privacy experts, such as Cynthia Dwork , have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness . Brian Christian wrote that experts have pivoted \"from the question of 'what they know' to the question of 'what they're doing with it'.\" [ 227 ] Generative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under the rationale of \" fair use \". Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include \"the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work\" and \"the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work\". [ 228 ] [ 229 ] Website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a \" robots.txt \" file. [ 230 ] In 2023, leading authors (including John Grisham and Jonathan Franzen ) sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI. [ 231 ] [ 232 ] Another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by AI to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors.

[ 237 ] [ 238 ] Power needs and environmental impacts See also: Environmental impacts of artificial intelligence In January 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released Electricity 2024, Analysis and Forecast to 2026 , forecasting electric power use. [ 239 ] This is the first IEA report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. The report states that power demand for these uses might double by 2026, with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole Japanese nation. [ 240 ] Prodigious power consumption by AI is responsible for the growth of fossil fuel use, and might delay closings of obsolete, carbon-emitting coal energy facilities. There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US, making large technology firms (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon) into voracious consumers of electric power. Projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search. The large firms are in haste to find power sources – from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. The tech firms argue that – in the long view – AI will be eventually kinder to the environment, but they need the energy now. AI makes the power grid more efficient and \"intelligent\", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to technology firms. [ 241 ] A 2024 Goldman Sachs Research Paper, AI Data Centers and the Coming US Power Demand Surge , found \"US power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation....\" and forecasts that, by 2030, US data centers will consume 8% of US power, as opposed to 3% in 2022, presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means. [ 242 ] Data centers' need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid. The Big Tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all. [ 243 ] In 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that big AI companies have begun negotiations with the US nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers. In March 2024 Amazon purchased a Pennsylvania nuclear-powered data center for US$650 million. [ 244 ] Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers. [ 245 ] In September 2024, Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation Energy to re-open the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100% of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years. Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission . If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power – enough for 800,000 homes – of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at US$1.6 billion and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act . [ 246 ] The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost US$2 billion to reopen the Palisades Nuclear reactor on Lake Michigan. Closed since 2022, the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO of Exelon who was responsible for Exelon's spinoff of Constellation.

[ 248 ] Although most nuclear plants in Japan have been shut down after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident , according to an October 2024 Bloomberg article in Japanese, cloud gaming services company Ubitus, in which Nvidia has a stake, is looking for land in Japan near a nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative AI. [ 249 ] Ubitus CEO Wesley Kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient, cheap and stable power for AI. [ 249 ] On 1 November 2024, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected an application submitted by Talen Energy for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station Susquehanna to Amazon's data center. [ 250 ] According to the Commission Chairman Willie L. Phillips , it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors. [ 250 ] In 2025, a report prepared by the International Energy Agency estimated the greenhouse gas emissions from the energy consumption of AI at 180 million tons. By 2035, these emissions could rise to 300–500 million tonnes depending on what measures will be taken. This is below 1.5% of the energy sector emissions. The emissions reduction potential of AI was estimated at 5% of the energy sector emissions, but rebound effects (for example if people switch from public transport to autonomous cars) can reduce it.

[ 266 ] [ 264 ] If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people (as it can in medicine , finance , recruitment , housing or policing ) then the algorithm may cause discrimination . [ 267 ] The field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases. On June 28, 2015, Google Photos 's new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as \"gorillas\" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people, [ 268 ] a problem called \"sample size disparity\". [ 269 ] Google \"fixed\" this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a \"gorilla\".

In 2016, Julia Angwin at ProPublica discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different—the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend. [ 271 ] In 2017, several researchers [ l ] showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data. [ 273 ] A program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as \"race\" or \"gender\"). The feature will correlate with other features (like \"address\", \"shopping history\" or \"first name\"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on \"race\" or \"gender\". [ 274 ] Moritz Hardt said \"the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn't work.\" [ 275 ] Criticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make \"predictions\" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions as recommendations , some of these \"recommendations\" will likely be racist.

Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases, but it may conflict with anti-discrimination laws . [ 263 ] At its 2022 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT 2022), the Association for Computing Machinery , in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings that recommend that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe, and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed.

[ 281 ] Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at \"low risk\" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data.

[ 299 ] In April 2023, it was reported that 70% of the jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence. [ 304 ] [ 305 ] Unlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist stated in 2015 that \"the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution\" is \"worth taking seriously\". [ 306 ] Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy. [ 307 ] From the early days of the development of artificial intelligence, there have been arguments, for example, those put forward by Joseph Weizenbaum , about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement. [ 308 ] Existential risk Main article: Existential risk from artificial intelligence It has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as physicist Stephen Hawking stated, \" spell the end of the human race \". [ 309 ] This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like \"self-awareness\" (or \"sentience\" or \"consciousness\") and becomes a malevolent character. [ q ] These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways. First, AI does not require human-like sentience to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of a paperclip maximizer ). [ 311 ] Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that \"you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead.\" [ 312 ] In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity's morality and values so that it is \"fundamentally on our side\". [ 313 ] Second, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like ideologies , law , government , money and the economy are built on language ; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive. [ 314 ] The opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI. [ 315 ] Personalities such as Stephen Hawking , Bill Gates , and Elon Musk , [ 316 ] as well as AI pioneers such as Yoshua Bengio , Stuart Russell , Demis Hassabis , and Sam Altman , have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI. In May 2023, Geoffrey Hinton announced his resignation from Google in order to be able to \"freely speak out about the risks of AI\" without \"considering how this impacts Google\". [ 317 ] He notably mentioned risks of an AI takeover , [ 318 ] and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes, establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI. [ 319 ] In 2023, many leading AI experts endorsed the joint statement that \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\". [ 320 ] Some other researchers were more optimistic. AI pioneer Jürgen Schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95% of all cases, AI research is about making \"human lives longer and healthier and easier.\" [ 321 ] While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, \"they can also be used against the bad actors.\" [ 322 ] [ 323 ] Andrew Ng also argued that \"it's a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI—and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests.\" [ 324 ] Yann LeCun \"scoffs at his peers' dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction.\" [ 325 ] In the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine.

[ 327 ] Ethical machines and alignment Main articles: Machine ethics , AI safety , Friendly artificial intelligence , Artificial moral agents , and Human Compatible Friendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. Eliezer Yudkowsky , who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk. [ 328 ] Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas. [ 329 ] The field of machine ethics is also called computational morality, [ 329 ] and was founded at an AAAI symposium in 2005. [ 330 ] Other approaches include Wendell Wallach 's \"artificial moral agents\" [ 331 ] and Stuart J. Russell 's three principles for developing provably beneficial machines. [ 332 ] Open source See also: Lists of open-source artificial intelligence software Active organizations in the AI open-source community include Hugging Face , [ 333 ] Google , [ 334 ] EleutherAI and Meta . [ 335 ] Various AI models, such as Llama 2 , Mistral or Stable Diffusion , have been made open-weight, [ 336 ] [ 337 ] meaning that their architecture and trained parameters (the \"weights\") are publicly available. Open-weight models can be freely fine-tuned , which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case. [ 338 ] Open-weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused. Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as objecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities (such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism ) and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed. They recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses. [ 339 ] Frameworks Artificial intelligence projects can be guided by ethical considerations during the design, development, and implementation of an AI system. An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework, developed by the Alan Turing Institute and based on the SUM values, outlines four main ethical dimensions, defined as follows: [ 340 ] [ 341 ] Respect the dignity of individual people Connect with other people sincerely, openly, and inclusively Care for the wellbeing of everyone Protect social values, justice, and the public interest Other developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the Asilomar Conference , the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, and the IEEE's Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative, among others; [ 342 ] however, these principles are not without criticism, especially regarding the people chosen to contribute to these frameworks. [ 343 ] Promotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of AI system design, development and implementation, and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists, product managers, data engineers, domain experts, and delivery managers. [ 344 ] The UK AI Safety Institute released in 2024 a testing toolset called 'Inspect' for AI safety evaluations available under an MIT open-source licence which is freely available on GitHub and can be improved with third-party packages. It can be used to evaluate AI models in a range of areas including core knowledge, ability to reason, and autonomous capabilities. [ 345 ] Regulation Main articles: Regulation of artificial intelligence , Regulation of algorithms , and AI safety The first global AI Safety Summit was held in the United Kingdom in November 2023 with a declaration calling for international cooperation. The regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI; it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms. [ 346 ] The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally. [ 347 ] According to AI Index at Stanford , the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone. [ 348 ] [ 349 ] Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI. [ 350 ] Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, U.S., and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia. [ 350 ] The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology. [ 350 ] Henry Kissinger , Eric Schmidt , and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI. [ 351 ] In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years. [ 352 ] In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, government officials and academics. [ 353 ] On 1 August 2024, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act entered into force, establishing the first comprehensive EU-wide AI regulation. [ 354 ] In 2024, the Council of Europe created the first international legally binding treaty on AI, called the \" Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law \". It was adopted by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other signatories. [ 355 ] In a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only 35% of Americans, agreed that \"products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks\". [ 348 ] A 2023 Reuters /Ipsos poll found that 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity. [ 356 ] In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35% of Americans thought it \"very important\", and an additional 41% thought it \"somewhat important\", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13% responding \"not very important\" and 8% responding \"not at all important\". [ 357 ] [ 358 ] In November 2023, the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks. [ 359 ] 28 countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of the summit, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence. [ 360 ] [ 361 ] In May 2024 at the AI Seoul Summit , 16 global AI tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of AI. [ 362 ] [ 363 ] History Main article: History of artificial intelligence For a chronological guide, see Timeline of artificial intelligence . In 2024, AI patents in China and the US numbered more than three-fourths of AI patents worldwide. [ 364 ] Though China had more AI patents, the US had 35% more patents per AI patent-applicant company than China. [ 364 ] The study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing 's theory of computation , which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning. [ 365 ] [ 366 ] This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics , information theory and neurobiology , led researchers to consider the possibility of building an \"electronic brain\". [ r ] They developed several areas of research that would become part of AI, [ 368 ] such as McCulloch and Pitts design for \"artificial neurons\" in 1943, [ 117 ] and Turing's influential 1950 paper ' Computing Machinery and Intelligence ', which introduced the Turing test and showed that \"machine intelligence\" was plausible. [ 369 ] [ 366 ] The field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956. [ s ] [ 6 ] The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s. [ t ] They and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\": [ u ] computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English. [ v ] [ 7 ] Artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and U.S. universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s. [ 366 ] Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field. [ 373 ] In 1965 Herbert Simon predicted, \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\". [ 374 ] In 1967 Marvin Minsky agreed, writing that \"within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved\". [ 375 ] They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 378 ] Minsky and Papert 's book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether. [ 379 ] The \" AI winter \", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed. [ 9 ] In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems , [ 380 ] a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research . [ 8 ] However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began. [ 10 ] Up to this point, most of AI's funding had gone to projects that used high-level symbols to represent mental objects like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception , robotics , learning and pattern recognition , [ 381 ] and began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches. [ 382 ] Rodney Brooks rejected \"representation\" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive. [ x ] Judea Pearl , Lotfi Zadeh , and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic. [ 87 ] [ 387 ] But the most important development was the revival of \" connectionism \", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others. [ 388 ] In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks. [ 389 ] AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems.

[ 391 ] However, several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or \"AGI\"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.

[ y ] Deep learning's success was based on both hardware improvements ( faster computers , [ 393 ] graphics processing units , cloud computing [ 394 ] ) and access to large amounts of data [ 395 ] (including curated datasets, [ 394 ] such as ImageNet ). Deep learning's success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI. [ z ] The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019. [ 350 ] The number of Google searches for the term \"AI\" accelerated in 2022. In 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. The alignment problem became a serious field of academic study. [ 327 ] In the late 2010s and early 2020s, AGI companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest. In 2015, AlphaGo , developed by DeepMind , beat the world champion Go player . The program taught only the game's rules and developed a strategy by itself. GPT-3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of generating high-quality human-like text. [ 396 ] ChatGPT , launched on November 30, 2022, became the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months. [ 397 ] It marked what is widely regarded as AI's breakout year, bringing it into the public consciousness. [ 398 ] These programs, and others, inspired an aggressive AI boom , where large companies began investing billions of dollars in AI research. According to AI Impacts, about US$50 billion annually was invested in \"AI\" around 2022 in the U.S. alone and about 20% of the new U.S. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in \"AI\". [ 399 ] About 800,000 \"AI\"-related U.S. job openings existed in 2022. [ 400 ] According to PitchBook research, 22% of newly funded startups in 2024 claimed to be AI companies. [ 401 ] Philosophy Main article: Philosophy of artificial intelligence Philosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines. [ 402 ] Another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious, and the associated ethical implications. [ 403 ] Many other topics in philosophy are relevant to AI, such as epistemology and free will . [ 404 ] Rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of AI . [ 403 ] Defining artificial intelligence See also: Synthetic intelligence , Intelligent agent , Artificial mind , Virtual intelligence , and Dartmouth workshop Alan Turing wrote in 1950 \"I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?\" [ 405 ] He advised changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\". [ 405 ] He devised the Turing test , which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation. [ 369 ] Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\". Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks.\" [ 406 ] The Turing test can provide some evidence of intelligence, but it penalizes non-human intelligent behavior. [ 407 ] Russell and Norvig agree with Turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior, not internal structure. [ 1 ] However, they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans. \" Aeronautical engineering texts\", they wrote, \"do not define the goal of their field as making 'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons. ' \" [ 408 ] AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\". [ 409 ] McCarthy defines intelligence as \"the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world\". [ 410 ] Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky , similarly describes it as \"the ability to solve hard problems\". [ 411 ] The leading AI textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. [ 1 ] These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the \"intelligence\" of the machine—and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible. Another definition has been adopted by Google, [ 412 ] a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence. As a result of the many circulating definitions scholars have started to critically analyze and order the AI discourse itself [ 413 ] including discussing the many AI narratives and myths to be found within societal, political and academic discourses. [ 414 ] Similarly, in practice, some authors have suggested that the term 'AI' is often used too broadly and vaguely. This raises the question of where the line should be drawn between AI and classical algorithms, [ 415 ] with many companies during the early 2020s AI boom using the term as a marketing buzzword , often even if they did \"not actually use AI in a material way\". [ 416 ] There has been debate over whether large language models exhibit genuine intelligence or merely simulate it by imitating human text . [ 417 ] Evaluating approaches to AI No established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history. [ aa ] The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\"). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic , soft and narrow . ", "strategy": "semantic"}

Symbolic AI and its limits Symbolic AI (or \" GOFAI \") [ 419 ] simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis : \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\" [ 420 ] However, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning . Moravec's paradox is the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for AI, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult. [ 421 ] Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge. [ 422 ] Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him. [ ab ] [ 16 ] The issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias . Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence, [ 424 ] [ 425 ] in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI : it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches. Neat vs. scruffy Main article: Neats and scruffies \"Neats\" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic , optimization , or neural networks ). \"Scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s, [ 426 ] but eventually was seen as irrelevant. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks. Narrow vs. general AI Main articles: Weak artificial intelligence and Artificial general intelligence AI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field's long-term goals. [ 427 ] [ 428 ] General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions.

Machine consciousness, sentience, and mind Main articles: Philosophy of artificial intelligence and Artificial consciousness There is no settled consensus in philosophy of mind on whether a machine can have a mind , consciousness and mental states in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence.

Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind–body problem . This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam . [ 432 ] Philosopher John Searle characterized this position as \" strong AI \": \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\" [ ac ] Searle challenges this claim with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind. [ 436 ] AI welfare and rights It is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient (has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree. [ 437 ] But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals. [ 438 ] [ 439 ] Sapience (a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment or self-awareness ) may provide another moral basis for AI rights. [ 438 ] Robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society. [ 440 ] In 2017, the European Union considered granting \"electronic personhood\" to some of the most capable AI systems. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities. [ 441 ] Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of human rights , and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios. They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part in society on their own. [ 442 ] [ 443 ] Progress in AI increased interest in the topic. Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny. They warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming , which could lead to large-scale suffering if sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited. [ 439 ] [ 438 ] Future Superintelligence and the singularity A superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind. [ 428 ] If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself . The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I. J. Good called an \" intelligence explosion \" and Vernor Vinge called a \" singularity \". [ 444 ] However, technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely, and typically follow an S-shaped curve , slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do. [ 445 ] Transhumanism Main article: Transhumanism Robot designer Hans Moravec , cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger . [ 446 ] Edward Fredkin argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution\", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler 's \" Darwin among the Machines \" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his 1998 book Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence . [ 447 ] In fiction Main article: Artificial intelligence in fiction The word \"robot\" itself was coined by Karel Čapek in his 1921 play R.U.R. , the title standing for \"Rossum's Universal Robots\". Thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity, [ 448 ] and have been a persistent theme in science fiction . [ 449 ] A common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein , where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke's and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000 , the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture. [ 450 ] Isaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many stories, most notably with the \" Multivac \" super-intelligent computer. Asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics; [ 451 ] while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity. [ 452 ] Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel , and thus to suffer. This appears in Karel Čapek 's R.U.R. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

The adjective \"deep\" refers to the use of multiple layers (ranging from three to several hundred or thousands) in the network. Methods used can be supervised , semi-supervised or unsupervised . [ 2 ] Some common deep learning network architectures include fully connected networks , deep belief networks , recurrent neural networks , convolutional neural networks , generative adversarial networks , transformers , and neural radiance fields . These architectures have been applied to fields including computer vision , speech recognition , natural language processing , machine translation , bioinformatics , drug design , medical image analysis , climate science , material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Early forms of neural networks were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems , particularly the human brain . However, current neural networks do not intend to model the brain function of organisms, and are generally seen as low-quality models for that purpose. [ 6 ] Overview [ edit source ] Most modern deep learning models are based on multi-layered neural networks such as convolutional neural networks and transformers , although they can also include propositional formulas or latent variables organized layer-wise in deep generative models such as the nodes in deep belief networks and deep Boltzmann machines . [ 7 ] Fundamentally, deep learning refers to a class of machine learning algorithms in which a hierarchy of layers is used to transform input data into a progressively more abstract and composite representation. For example, in an image recognition model, the raw input may be an image (represented as a tensor of pixels ). The first representational layer may attempt to identify basic shapes such as lines and circles, the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges, the third layer may encode a nose and eyes, and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains a face. Importantly, a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place at which level on its own . Prior to deep learning, machine learning techniques often involved hand-crafted feature engineering to transform the data into a more suitable representation for a classification algorithm to operate on. In the deep learning approach, features are not hand-crafted and the model discovers useful feature representations from the data automatically. This does not eliminate the need for hand-tuning; for example, varying numbers of layers and layer sizes can provide different degrees of abstraction. [ 8 ] [ 2 ] The word \"deep\" in \"deep learning\" refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed. More precisely, deep learning systems have a substantial credit assignment path (CAP) depth. The CAP is the chain of transformations from input to output. CAPs describe potentially causal connections between input and output. For a feedforward neural network , the depth of the CAPs is that of the network and is the number of hidden layers plus one (as the output layer is also parameterized). For recurrent neural networks , in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once, the CAP depth is potentially unlimited. [ 9 ] No universally agreed-upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning, but most researchers agree that deep learning involves CAP depth higher than two. CAP of depth two has been shown to be a universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function. [ 10 ] Beyond that, more layers do not add to the function approximator ability of the network. Deep models (CAP > two) are able to extract better features than shallow models and hence, extra layers help in learning the features effectively. Deep learning architectures can be constructed with a greedy layer-by-layer method. [ 11 ] Deep learning helps to disentangle these abstractions and pick out which features improve performance. [ 8 ] Deep learning algorithms can be applied to unsupervised learning tasks. This is an important benefit because unlabeled data is more abundant than the labeled data. Examples of deep structures that can be trained in an unsupervised manner are deep belief networks . [ 8 ] [ 12 ] The term deep learning was introduced to the machine learning community by Rina Dechter in 1986, [ 13 ] and to artificial neural networks by Igor Aizenberg and colleagues in 2000, in the context of Boolean threshold neurons. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Although the history of its appearance is apparently more complicated. [ 16 ] Interpretations [ edit source ] Deep neural networks are generally interpreted in terms of the universal approximation theorem [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] or probabilistic inference . [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 24 ] The classic universal approximation theorem concerns the capacity of feedforward neural networks with a single hidden layer of finite size to approximate continuous functions . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] In 1989, the first proof was published by George Cybenko for sigmoid activation functions [ 17 ] and was generalised to feed-forward multi-layer architectures in 1991 by Kurt Hornik. [ 18 ] Recent work also showed that universal approximation also holds for non-bounded activation functions such as Kunihiko Fukushima 's rectified linear unit . [ 25 ] [ 26 ] The universal approximation theorem for deep neural networks concerns the capacity of networks with bounded width but the depth is allowed to grow. Lu et al. [ 21 ] proved that if the width of a deep neural network with ReLU activation is strictly larger than the input dimension, then the network can approximate any Lebesgue integrable function ; if the width is smaller or equal to the input dimension, then a deep neural network is not a universal approximator. The probabilistic interpretation [ 24 ] derives from the field of machine learning . ", "strategy": "semantic"}

More specifically, the probabilistic interpretation considers the activation nonlinearity as a cumulative distribution function . [ 24 ] The probabilistic interpretation led to the introduction of dropout as regularizer in neural networks. The probabilistic interpretation was introduced by researchers including Hopfield , Widrow and Narendra and popularized in surveys such as the one by Bishop . [ 27 ] History [ edit source ] Before 1980 [ edit source ] There are two types of artificial neural network (ANN): feedforward neural network (FNN) or multilayer perceptron (MLP) and recurrent neural networks (RNN). RNNs have cycles in their connectivity structure, FNNs don't. In the 1920s, Wilhelm Lenz and Ernst Ising created the Ising model [ 28 ] [ 29 ] which is essentially a non-learning RNN architecture consisting of neuron-like threshold elements. In 1972, Shun'ichi Amari made this architecture adaptive. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 32 ] Other early recurrent neural networks were published by Kaoru Nakano in 1971. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Already in 1948, Alan Turing produced work on \"Intelligent Machinery\" that was not published in his lifetime, [ 35 ] containing \"ideas related to artificial evolution and learning RNNs\". [ 31 ] Frank Rosenblatt (1958) [ 36 ] proposed the perceptron, an MLP with 3 layers: an input layer, a hidden layer with randomized weights that did not learn, and an output layer. He later published a 1962 book that also introduced variants and computer experiments, including a version with four-layer perceptrons \"with adaptive preterminal networks\" where the last two layers have learned weights (here he credits H. D. Block and B. W. Knight). [ 37 ] : section 16 The book cites an earlier network by R. D. Joseph (1960) [ 38 ] \"functionally equivalent to a variation of\" this four-layer system (the book mentions Joseph over 30 times). Should Joseph therefore be considered the originator of proper adaptive multilayer perceptrons with learning hidden units? Unfortunately, the learning algorithm was not a functional one, and fell into oblivion. The first working deep learning algorithm was the Group method of data handling , a method to train arbitrarily deep neural networks, published by Alexey Ivakhnenko and Lapa in 1965. They regarded it as a form of polynomial regression, [ 39 ] or a generalization of Rosenblatt's perceptron to handle more complex, nonlinear, and hierarchical relationships. [ 40 ] A 1971 paper described a deep network with eight layers trained by this method, [ 41 ] which is based on layer by layer training through regression analysis. Superfluous hidden units are pruned using a separate validation set. Since the activation functions of the nodes are Kolmogorov-Gabor polynomials, these were also the first deep networks with multiplicative units or \"gates\". [ 31 ] The first deep learning multilayer perceptron trained by stochastic gradient descent [ 42 ] was published in 1967 by Shun'ichi Amari . [ 43 ] In computer experiments conducted by Amari's student Saito, a five layer MLP with two modifiable layers learned internal representations to classify non-linearily separable pattern classes. [ 31 ] Subsequent developments in hardware and hyperparameter tunings have made end-to-end stochastic gradient descent the currently dominant training technique. In 1969, Kunihiko Fukushima introduced the ReLU (rectified linear unit) activation function . [ 25 ] [ 31 ] The rectifier has become the most popular activation function for deep learning. [ 44 ] Deep learning architectures for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with convolutional layers and downsampling layers began with the Neocognitron introduced by Kunihiko Fukushima in 1979, though not trained by backpropagation. [ 45 ] [ 46 ] Backpropagation is an efficient application of the chain rule derived by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1673 [ 47 ] to networks of differentiable nodes. The terminology \"back-propagating errors\" was actually introduced in 1962 by Rosenblatt, [ 37 ] but he did not know how to implement this, although Henry J. Kelley had a continuous precursor of backpropagation in 1960 in the context of control theory . [ 48 ] The modern form of backpropagation was first published in Seppo Linnainmaa 's master thesis (1970). [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 31 ] G.M. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

It used convolutions, weight sharing, and backpropagation. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] In 1988, Wei Zhang applied a backpropagation-trained CNN to alphabet recognition. [ 59 ] In 1989, Yann LeCun et al. created a CNN called LeNet for recognizing handwritten ZIP codes on mail. Training required 3 days. [ 60 ] In 1990, Wei Zhang implemented a CNN on optical computing hardware. [ 61 ] In 1991, a CNN was applied to medical image object segmentation [ 62 ] and breast cancer detection in mammograms. [ 63 ] LeNet -5 (1998), a 7-level CNN by Yann LeCun et al., that classifies digits, was applied by several banks to recognize hand-written numbers on checks digitized in 32x32 pixel images. [ 64 ] Recurrent neural networks (RNN) [ 28 ] [ 30 ] were further developed in the 1980s. Recurrence is used for sequence processing, and when a recurrent network is unrolled, it mathematically resembles a deep feedforward layer. Consequently, they have similar properties and issues, and their developments had mutual influences. In RNN, two early influential works were the Jordan network (1986) [ 65 ] and the Elman network (1990), [ 66 ] which applied RNN to study problems in cognitive psychology . In the 1980s, backpropagation did not work well for deep learning with long credit assignment paths. To overcome this problem, in 1991, Jürgen Schmidhuber proposed a hierarchy of RNNs pre-trained one level at a time by self-supervised learning where each RNN tries to predict its own next input, which is the next unexpected input of the RNN below. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] This \"neural history compressor\" uses predictive coding to learn internal representations at multiple self-organizing time scales. This can substantially facilitate downstream deep learning. The RNN hierarchy can be collapsed into a single RNN, by distilling a higher level chunker network into a lower level automatizer network. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 31 ] In 1993, a neural history compressor solved a \"Very Deep Learning\" task that required more than 1000 subsequent layers in an RNN unfolded in time. [ 69 ] The \"P\" in ChatGPT refers to such pre-training. Sepp Hochreiter 's diploma thesis (1991) [ 70 ] implemented the neural history compressor, [ 67 ] and identified and analyzed the vanishing gradient problem . [ 70 ] [ 71 ] Hochreiter proposed recurrent residual connections to solve the vanishing gradient problem. This led to the long short-term memory (LSTM), published in 1995. [ 72 ] LSTM can learn \"very deep learning\" tasks [ 9 ] with long credit assignment paths that require memories of events that happened thousands of discrete time steps before. That LSTM was not yet the modern architecture, which required a \"forget gate\", introduced in 1999, [ 73 ] which became the standard RNN architecture. In 1991, Jürgen Schmidhuber also published adversarial neural networks that contest with each other in the form of a zero-sum game , where one network's gain is the other network's loss. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] The first network is a generative model that models a probability distribution over output patterns. The second network learns by gradient descent to predict the reactions of the environment to these patterns. This was called \"artificial curiosity\". In 2014, this principle was used in generative adversarial networks (GANs). [ 76 ] During 1985–1995, inspired by statistical mechanics, several architectures and methods were developed by Terry Sejnowski , Peter Dayan , Geoffrey Hinton , etc., including the Boltzmann machine , [ 77 ] restricted Boltzmann machine , [ 78 ] Helmholtz machine , [ 79 ] and the wake-sleep algorithm . [ 80 ] These were designed for unsupervised learning of deep generative models. However, those were more computationally expensive compared to backpropagation. Boltzmann machine learning algorithm, published in 1985, was briefly popular before being eclipsed by the backpropagation algorithm in 1986. (p. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

A 1988 network became state of the art in protein structure prediction , an early application of deep learning to bioinformatics. [ 82 ] Both shallow and deep learning (e.g., recurrent nets) of ANNs for speech recognition have been explored for many years. [ 83 ] [ 84 ] [ 85 ] These methods never outperformed non-uniform internal-handcrafting Gaussian mixture model / Hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) technology based on generative models of speech trained discriminatively. [ 86 ] Key difficulties have been analyzed, including gradient diminishing [ 70 ] and weak temporal correlation structure in neural predictive models. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] Additional difficulties were the lack of training data and limited computing power. Most speech recognition researchers moved away from neural nets to pursue generative modeling. An exception was at SRI International in the late 1990s. Funded by the US government's NSA and DARPA , SRI researched in speech and speaker recognition . The speaker recognition team led by Larry Heck reported significant success with deep neural networks in speech processing in the 1998 NIST Speaker Recognition benchmark. [ 89 ] [ 90 ] It was deployed in the Nuance Verifier, representing the first major industrial application of deep learning. [ 91 ] The principle of elevating \"raw\" features over hand-crafted optimization was first explored successfully in the architecture of deep autoencoder on the \"raw\" spectrogram or linear filter-bank features in the late 1990s, [ 90 ] showing its superiority over the Mel-Cepstral features that contain stages of fixed transformation from spectrograms. The raw features of speech, waveforms , later produced excellent larger-scale results. [ 92 ] 2000s [ edit source ] Neural networks entered a lull, and simpler models that use task-specific handcrafted features such as Gabor filters and support vector machines (SVMs) became the preferred choices in the 1990s and 2000s, because of artificial neural networks' computational cost and a lack of understanding of how the brain wires its biological networks. [ citation needed ] In 2003, LSTM became competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks. [ 93 ] In 2006, Alex Graves , Santiago Fernández, Faustino Gomez, and Schmidhuber combined it with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) [ 94 ] in stacks of LSTMs. [ 95 ] In 2009, it became the first RNN to win a pattern recognition contest, in connected handwriting recognition . [ 96 ] [ 9 ] In 2006, publications by Geoff Hinton , Ruslan Salakhutdinov , Osindero and Teh [ 97 ] [ 98 ] deep belief networks were developed for generative modeling. They are trained by training one restricted Boltzmann machine, then freezing it and training another one on top of the first one, and so on, then optionally fine-tuned using supervised backpropagation. [ 99 ] They could model high-dimensional probability distributions, such as the distribution of MNIST images , but convergence was slow. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] [ 102 ] The impact of deep learning in industry began in the early 2000s, when CNNs already processed an estimated 10% to 20% of all the checks written in the US, according to Yann LeCun. [ 103 ] Industrial applications of deep learning to large-scale speech recognition started around 2010. The 2009 NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning for Speech Recognition was motivated by the limitations of deep generative models of speech, and the possibility that given more capable hardware and large-scale data sets that deep neural nets might become practical. It was believed that pre-training DNNs using generative models of deep belief nets (DBN) would overcome the main difficulties of neural nets. However, it was discovered that replacing pre-training with large amounts of training data for straightforward backpropagation when using DNNs with large, context-dependent output layers produced error rates dramatically lower than then-state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture model (GMM)/Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and also than more-advanced generative model-based systems. [ 104 ] The nature of the recognition errors produced by the two types of systems was characteristically different, [ 105 ] offering technical insights into how to integrate deep learning into the existing highly efficient, run-time speech decoding system deployed by all major speech recognition systems. [ 23 ] [ 106 ] [ 107 ] Analysis around 2009–2010, contrasting the GMM (and other generative speech models) vs. DNN models, stimulated early industrial investment in deep learning for speech recognition. [ 105 ] That analysis was done with comparable performance (less than 1.5% in error rate) between discriminative DNNs and generative models. [ 104 ] [ 105 ] [ 108 ] In 2010, researchers extended deep learning from TIMIT to large vocabulary speech recognition, by adopting large output layers of the DNN based on context-dependent HMM states constructed by decision trees . [ 109 ] [ 110 ] [ 111 ] [ 106 ] Deep learning revolution [ edit source ] How deep learning is a subset of machine learning and how machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) The deep learning revolution started around CNN- and GPU-based computer vision. Although CNNs trained by backpropagation had been around for decades and GPU implementations of NNs for years, [ 112 ] including CNNs, [ 113 ] faster implementations of CNNs on GPUs were needed to progress on computer vision. Later, as deep learning becomes widespread, specialized hardware and algorithm optimizations were developed specifically for deep learning. [ 114 ] A key advance for the deep learning revolution was hardware advances, especially GPU. Some early work dated back to 2004. [ 112 ] [ 113 ] In 2009, Raina, Madhavan, and Andrew Ng reported a 100M deep belief network trained on 30 Nvidia GeForce GTX 280 GPUs, an early demonstration of GPU-based deep learning. They reported up to 70 times faster training. [ 115 ] In 2011, a CNN named DanNet [ 116 ] [ 117 ] by Dan Ciresan, Ueli Meier, Jonathan Masci, Luca Maria Gambardella , and Jürgen Schmidhuber achieved for the first time superhuman performance in a visual pattern recognition contest, outperforming traditional methods by a factor of 3. [ 9 ] It then won more contests. [ 118 ] [ 119 ] They also showed how max-pooling CNNs on GPU improved performance significantly. [ 3 ] In 2012, Andrew Ng and Jeff Dean created an FNN that learned to recognize higher-level concepts, such as cats, only from watching unlabeled images taken from YouTube videos. [ 120 ] In October 2012, AlexNet by Alex Krizhevsky , Ilya Sutskever , and Geoffrey Hinton [ 4 ] won the large-scale ImageNet competition by a significant margin over shallow machine learning methods. Further incremental improvements included the VGG-16 network by Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman [ 121 ] and Google's Inceptionv3 . [ 122 ] The success in image classification was then extended to the more challenging task of generating descriptions (captions) for images, often as a combination of CNNs and LSTMs. [ 123 ] [ 124 ] [ 125 ] In 2014, the state of the art was training “very deep neural network” with 20 to 30 layers.

[ 128 ] In 2015, two techniques were developed to train very deep networks: the Highway Network was published in May 2015, and the residual neural network (ResNet) [ 129 ] in Dec 2015. ResNet behaves like an open-gated Highway Net. Around the same time, deep learning started impacting the field of art. Early examples included Google DeepDream (2015), and neural style transfer (2015), [ 130 ] both of which were based on pretrained image classification neural networks, such as VGG-19 . Generative adversarial network (GAN) by ( Ian Goodfellow et al., 2014) [ 131 ] (based on Jürgen Schmidhuber 's principle of artificial curiosity [ 74 ] [ 76 ] ) became state of the art in generative modeling during 2014-2018 period. Excellent image quality is achieved by Nvidia 's StyleGAN (2018) [ 132 ] based on the Progressive GAN by Tero Karras et al. [ 133 ] Here the GAN generator is grown from small to large scale in a pyramidal fashion. Image generation by GAN reached popular success, and provoked discussions concerning deepfakes . [ 134 ] Diffusion models (2015) [ 135 ] eclipsed GANs in generative modeling since then, with systems such as DALL·E 2 (2022) and Stable Diffusion (2022). In 2015, Google's speech recognition improved by 49% by an LSTM-based model, which they made available through Google Voice Search on smartphone . [ 136 ] [ 137 ] Deep learning is part of state-of-the-art systems in various disciplines, particularly computer vision and automatic speech recognition (ASR). Results on commonly used evaluation sets such as TIMIT (ASR) and MNIST ( image classification ), as well as a range of large-vocabulary speech recognition tasks have steadily improved. [ 104 ] [ 138 ] Convolutional neural networks were superseded for ASR by LSTM . [ 137 ] [ 139 ] [ 140 ] [ 141 ] but are more successful in computer vision. Yoshua Bengio , Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun were awarded the 2018 Turing Award for \"conceptual and engineering breakthroughs that have made deep neural networks a critical component of computing\". [ 142 ] Neural networks [ edit source ] Main article: Artificial neural network Simplified example of training a neural network in object detection: The network is trained by multiple images that are known to depict starfish and sea urchins , which are correlated with \"nodes\" that represent visual features . The starfish match with a ringed texture and a star outline, whereas most sea urchins match with a striped texture and oval shape. However, the instance of a ring textured sea urchin creates a weakly weighted association between them. Subsequent run of the network on an input image (left): [ 143 ] The network correctly detects the starfish. However, the weakly weighted association between ringed texture and sea urchin also confers a weak signal to the latter from one of two intermediate nodes. In addition, a shell that was not included in the training gives a weak signal for the oval shape, also resulting in a weak signal for the sea urchin output. These weak signals may result in a false positive result for sea urchin. In reality, textures and outlines would not be represented by single nodes, but rather by associated weight patterns of multiple nodes. Artificial neural networks ( ANNs ) or connectionist systems are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems learn (progressively improve their ability) to do tasks by considering examples, generally without task-specific programming. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

They have found most use in applications difficult to express with a traditional computer algorithm using rule-based programming . An ANN is based on a collection of connected units called artificial neurons , (analogous to biological neurons in a biological brain ). Each connection ( synapse ) between neurons can transmit a signal to another neuron. The receiving (postsynaptic) neuron can process the signal(s) and then signal downstream neurons connected to it. Neurons may have state, generally represented by real numbers , typically between 0 and 1. Neurons and synapses may also have a weight that varies as learning proceeds, which can increase or decrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream. Typically, neurons are organized in layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first (input), to the last (output) layer, possibly after traversing the layers multiple times. The original goal of the neural network approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. Over time, attention focused on matching specific mental abilities, leading to deviations from biology such as backpropagation , or passing information in the reverse direction and adjusting the network to reflect that information. Neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition , machine translation , social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis. As of 2017, neural networks typically have a few thousand to a few million units and millions of connections. Despite this number being several order of magnitude less than the number of neurons on a human brain, these networks can perform many tasks at a level beyond that of humans (e.g., recognizing faces, or playing \"Go\" [ 144 ] ). Deep neural networks [ edit source ] A deep neural network (DNN) is an artificial neural network with multiple layers between the input and output layers. [ 7 ] [ 9 ] There are different types of neural networks but they always consist of the same components: neurons, synapses, weights, biases, and functions. [ 145 ] These components as a whole function in a way that mimics functions of the human brain, and can be trained like any other ML algorithm. [ citation needed ] For example, a DNN that is trained to recognize dog breeds will go over the given image and calculate the probability that the dog in the image is a certain breed. The user can review the results and select which probabilities the network should display (above a certain threshold, etc.) and return the proposed label. Each mathematical manipulation as such is considered a layer, [ 146 ] and complex DNN have many layers, hence the name \"deep\" networks. DNNs can model complex non-linear relationships. DNN architectures generate compositional models where the object is expressed as a layered composition of primitives . [ 147 ] The extra layers enable composition of features from lower layers, potentially modeling complex data with fewer units than a similarly performing shallow network. [ 7 ] For instance, it was proved that sparse multivariate polynomials are exponentially easier to approximate with DNNs than with shallow networks. [ 148 ] Deep architectures include many variants of a few basic approaches. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

The weights and inputs are multiplied and return an output between 0 and 1. If the network did not accurately recognize a particular pattern, an algorithm would adjust the weights. [ 149 ] That way the algorithm can make certain parameters more influential, until it determines the correct mathematical manipulation to fully process the data. Recurrent neural networks , in which data can flow in any direction, are used for applications such as language modeling . [ 150 ] [ 151 ] [ 152 ] [ 153 ] [ 154 ] Long short-term memory is particularly effective for this use. [ 155 ] [ 156 ] Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used in computer vision. [ 157 ] CNNs also have been applied to acoustic modeling for automatic speech recognition (ASR). [ 158 ] Challenges [ edit source ] As with ANNs, many issues can arise with naively trained DNNs. Two common issues are overfitting and computation time. DNNs are prone to overfitting because of the added layers of abstraction, which allow them to model rare dependencies in the training data. Regularization methods such as Ivakhnenko's unit pruning [ 41 ] or weight decay ( ℓ 2 {\\displaystyle \\ell _{2}} -regularization) or sparsity ( ℓ 1 {\\displaystyle \\ell _{1}} -regularization) can be applied during training to combat overfitting. [ 159 ] Alternatively dropout regularization randomly omits units from the hidden layers during training. This helps to exclude rare dependencies. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

This approach has been successfully applied for multivariate time series prediction tasks such as traffic prediction. [ 161 ] Finally, data can be augmented via methods such as cropping and rotating such that smaller training sets can be increased in size to reduce the chances of overfitting. [ 162 ] DNNs must consider many training parameters, such as the size (number of layers and number of units per layer), the learning rate , and initial weights. Sweeping through the parameter space for optimal parameters may not be feasible due to the cost in time and computational resources. Various tricks, such as batching (computing the gradient on several training examples at once rather than individual examples) [ 163 ] speed up computation. Large processing capabilities of many-core architectures (such as GPUs or the Intel Xeon Phi) have produced significant speedups in training, because of the suitability of such processing architectures for the matrix and vector computations. [ 164 ] [ 165 ] Alternatively, engineers may look for other types of neural networks with more straightforward and convergent training algorithms.

[ 168 ] By 2019, graphics processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method for training large-scale commercial cloud AI . [ 169 ] OpenAI estimated the hardware computation used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017) and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of computation required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months. [ 170 ] [ 171 ] Special electronic circuits called deep learning processors were designed to speed up deep learning algorithms. Deep learning processors include neural processing units (NPUs) in Huawei cellphones [ 172 ] and cloud computing servers such as tensor processing units (TPU) in the Google Cloud Platform . [ 173 ] Cerebras Systems has also built a dedicated system to handle large deep learning models, the CS-2, based on the largest processor in the industry, the second-generation Wafer Scale Engine (WSE-2). [ 174 ] [ 175 ] Atomically thin semiconductors are considered promising for energy-efficient deep learning hardware where the same basic device structure is used for both logic operations and data storage. In 2020, Marega et al. published experiments with a large-area active channel material for developing logic-in-memory devices and circuits based on floating-gate field-effect transistors (FGFETs). [ 176 ] In 2021, J. Feldmann et al. proposed an integrated photonic hardware accelerator for parallel convolutional processing. [ 177 ] The authors identify two key advantages of integrated photonics over its electronic counterparts: (1) massively parallel data transfer through wavelength division multiplexing in conjunction with frequency combs , and (2) extremely high data modulation speeds. [ 177 ] Their system can execute trillions of multiply-accumulate operations per second, indicating the potential of integrated photonics in data-heavy AI applications.

LSTM RNNs can learn \"Very Deep Learning\" tasks [ 9 ] that involve multi-second intervals containing speech events separated by thousands of discrete time steps, where one time step corresponds to about 10 ms. LSTM with forget gates [ 156 ] is competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks. [ 93 ] The initial success in speech recognition was based on small-scale recognition tasks based on TIMIT. The data set contains 630 speakers from eight major dialects of American English , where each speaker reads 10 sentences. [ 178 ] Its small size lets many configurations be tried. More importantly, the TIMIT task concerns phone -sequence recognition, which, unlike word-sequence recognition, allows weak phone bigram language models. This lets the strength of the acoustic modeling aspects of speech recognition be more easily analyzed.

Bioinformatics [ edit source ] Main article: Bioinformatics An autoencoder ANN was used in bioinformatics , to predict gene ontology annotations and gene-function relationships. [ 227 ] In medical informatics, deep learning was used to predict sleep quality based on data from wearables [ 228 ] and predictions of health complications from electronic health record data. [ 229 ] Deep neural networks have shown unparalleled performance in predicting protein structure , according to the sequence of the amino acids that make it up. In 2020, AlphaFold , a deep-learning based system, achieved a level of accuracy significantly higher than all previous computational methods. [ 230 ] [ 231 ] Deep Neural Network Estimations [ edit source ] Deep neural networks can be used to estimate the entropy of a stochastic process and called Neural Joint Entropy Estimator (NJEE). [ 232 ] Such an estimation provides insights on the effects of input random variables on an independent random variable . Practically, the DNN is trained as a classifier that maps an input vector or matrix X to an output probability distribution over the possible classes of random variable Y, given input X. For example, in image classification tasks, the NJEE maps a vector of pixels ' color values to probabilities over possible image classes. In practice, the probability distribution of Y is obtained by a Softmax layer with number of nodes that is equal to the alphabet size of Y. NJEE uses continuously differentiable activation functions , such that the conditions for the universal approximation theorem holds. It is shown that this method provides a strongly consistent estimator and outperforms other methods in case of large alphabet sizes. [ 232 ] Medical image analysis [ edit source ] Deep learning has been shown to produce competitive results in medical application such as cancer cell classification, lesion detection, organ segmentation and image enhancement.

This information can form the basis of machine learning to improve ad selection. Image restoration [ edit source ] Deep learning has been successfully applied to inverse problems such as denoising , super-resolution , inpainting , and film colorization . [ 238 ] These applications include learning methods such as \"Shrinkage Fields for Effective Image Restoration\" [ 239 ] which trains on an image dataset, and Deep Image Prior , which trains on the image that needs restoration. Financial fraud detection [ edit source ] Deep learning is being successfully applied to financial fraud detection , tax evasion detection, [ 240 ] and anti-money laundering. [ 241 ] Materials science [ edit source ] In November 2023, researchers at Google DeepMind and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory announced that they had developed an AI system known as GNoME. This system has contributed to materials science by discovering over 2 million new materials within a relatively short timeframe. GNoME employs deep learning techniques to efficiently explore potential material structures, achieving a significant increase in the identification of stable inorganic crystal structures . The system's predictions were validated through autonomous robotic experiments, demonstrating a noteworthy success rate of 71%. The data of newly discovered materials is publicly available through the Materials Project database, offering researchers the opportunity to identify materials with desired properties for various applications. This development has implications for the future of scientific discovery and the integration of AI in material science research, potentially expediting material innovation and reducing costs in product development. The use of AI and deep learning suggests the possibility of minimizing or eliminating manual lab experiments and allowing scientists to focus more on the design and analysis of unique compounds. [ 242 ] [ 243 ] [ 244 ] Military [ edit source ] The United States Department of Defense applied deep learning to train robots in new tasks through observation. [ 245 ] Partial differential equations [ edit source ] Physics informed neural networks have been used to solve partial differential equations in both forward and inverse problems in a data driven manner. [ 246 ] One example is the reconstructing fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equations . Using physics informed neural networks does not require the often expensive mesh generation that conventional CFD methods rely on. [ 247 ] [ 248 ] Deep backward stochastic differential equation method [ edit source ] Deep backward stochastic differential equation method is a numerical method that combines deep learning with Backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE). This method is particularly useful for solving high-dimensional problems in financial mathematics. By leveraging the powerful function approximation capabilities of deep neural networks , deep BSDE addresses the computational challenges faced by traditional numerical methods in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, traditional methods like finite difference methods or Monte Carlo simulations often struggle with the curse of dimensionality, where computational cost increases exponentially with the number of dimensions. Deep BSDE methods, however, employ deep neural networks to approximate solutions of high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), effectively reducing the computational burden. [ 249 ] In addition, the integration of Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) into the deep BSDE framework enhances its capability by embedding the underlying physical laws directly into the neural network architecture. This ensures that the solutions not only fit the data but also adhere to the governing stochastic differential equations. PINNs leverage the power of deep learning while respecting the constraints imposed by the physical models, resulting in more accurate and reliable solutions for financial mathematics problems. Image reconstruction [ edit source ] Image reconstruction is the reconstruction of the underlying images from the image-related measurements. Several works showed the better and superior performance of the deep learning methods compared to analytical methods for various applications, e.g., spectral imaging [ 250 ] and ultrasound imaging. [ 251 ] Weather prediction [ edit source ] Traditional weather prediction systems solve a very complex system of partial differential equations. GraphCast is a deep learning based model, trained on a long history of weather data to predict how weather patterns change over time. It is able to predict weather conditions for up to 10 days globally, at a very detailed level, and in under a minute, with precision similar to state of the art systems. [ 252 ] [ 253 ] Epigenetic clock [ edit source ] Main article: Epigenetic clock An epigenetic clock is a biochemical test that can be used to measure age. Galkin et al. used deep neural networks to train an epigenetic aging clock of unprecedented accuracy using >6,000 blood samples. [ 254 ] The clock uses information from 1000 CpG sites and predicts people with certain conditions older than healthy controls: IBD , frontotemporal dementia , ovarian cancer , obesity . The aging clock was planned to be released for public use in 2021 by an Insilico Medicine spinoff company Deep Longevity. Relation to human cognitive and brain development [ edit source ] Deep learning is closely related to a class of theories of brain development (specifically, neocortical development) proposed by cognitive neuroscientists in the early 1990s. [ 255 ] [ 256 ] [ 257 ] [ 258 ] These developmental theories were instantiated in computational models, making them predecessors of deep learning systems. These developmental models share the property that various proposed learning dynamics in the brain (e.g., a wave of nerve growth factor ) support the self-organization somewhat analogous to the neural networks utilized in deep learning models. Like the neocortex , neural networks employ a hierarchy of layered filters in which each layer considers information from a prior layer (or the operating environment), and then passes its output (and possibly the original input), to other layers. This process yields a self-organizing stack of transducers , well-tuned to their operating environment. A 1995 description stated, \"...the infant's brain seems to organize itself under the influence of waves of so-called trophic-factors ... different regions of the brain become connected sequentially, with one layer of tissue maturing before another and so on until the whole brain is mature\". [ 259 ] A variety of approaches have been used to investigate the plausibility of deep learning models from a neurobiological perspective. On the one hand, several variants of the backpropagation algorithm have been proposed in order to increase its processing realism. [ 260 ] [ 261 ] Other researchers have argued that unsupervised forms of deep learning, such as those based on hierarchical generative models and deep belief networks , may be closer to biological reality. [ 262 ] [ 263 ] In this respect, generative neural network models have been related to neurobiological evidence about sampling-based processing in the cerebral cortex. [ 264 ] Although a systematic comparison between the human brain organization and the neuronal encoding in deep networks has not yet been established, several analogies have been reported. For example, the computations performed by deep learning units could be similar to those of actual neurons [ 265 ] and neural populations. [ 266 ] Similarly, the representations developed by deep learning models are similar to those measured in the primate visual system [ 267 ] both at the single-unit [ 268 ] and at the population [ 269 ] levels.", "strategy": "semantic"}

The adjective \"deep\" refers to the use of multiple layers (ranging from three to several hundred or thousands) in the network. Methods used can be supervised , semi-supervised or unsupervised . [ 2 ] Some common deep learning network architectures include fully connected networks , deep belief networks , recurrent neural networks , convolutional neural networks , generative adversarial networks , transformers , and neural radiance fields . These architectures have been applied to fields including computer vision , speech recognition , natural language processing , machine translation , bioinformatics , drug design , medical image analysis , climate science , material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Early forms of neural networks were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems , particularly the human brain . However, current neural networks do not intend to model the brain function of organisms, and are generally seen as low-quality models for that purpose. [ 6 ] Overview [ edit source ] Most modern deep learning models are based on multi-layered neural networks such as convolutional neural networks and transformers , although they can also include propositional formulas or latent variables organized layer-wise in deep generative models such as the nodes in deep belief networks and deep Boltzmann machines . [ 7 ] Fundamentally, deep learning refers to a class of machine learning algorithms in which a hierarchy of layers is used to transform input data into a progressively more abstract and composite representation. For example, in an image recognition model, the raw input may be an image (represented as a tensor of pixels ). The first representational layer may attempt to identify basic shapes such as lines and circles, the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges, the third layer may encode a nose and eyes, and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains a face. Importantly, a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place at which level on its own . Prior to deep learning, machine learning techniques often involved hand-crafted feature engineering to transform the data into a more suitable representation for a classification algorithm to operate on. In the deep learning approach, features are not hand-crafted and the model discovers useful feature representations from the data automatically. This does not eliminate the need for hand-tuning; for example, varying numbers of layers and layer sizes can provide different degrees of abstraction. [ 8 ] [ 2 ] The word \"deep\" in \"deep learning\" refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed. More precisely, deep learning systems have a substantial credit assignment path (CAP) depth. The CAP is the chain of transformations from input to output. CAPs describe potentially causal connections between input and output. For a feedforward neural network , the depth of the CAPs is that of the network and is the number of hidden layers plus one (as the output layer is also parameterized). For recurrent neural networks , in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once, the CAP depth is potentially unlimited. [ 9 ] No universally agreed-upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning, but most researchers agree that deep learning involves CAP depth higher than two. CAP of depth two has been shown to be a universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function. [ 10 ] Beyond that, more layers do not add to the function approximator ability of the network. Deep models (CAP > two) are able to extract better features than shallow models and hence, extra layers help in learning the features effectively. Deep learning architectures can be constructed with a greedy layer-by-layer method. [ 11 ] Deep learning helps to disentangle these abstractions and pick out which features improve performance. [ 8 ] Deep learning algorithms can be applied to unsupervised learning tasks. This is an important benefit because unlabeled data is more abundant than the labeled data. Examples of deep structures that can be trained in an unsupervised manner are deep belief networks . [ 8 ] [ 12 ] The term deep learning was introduced to the machine learning community by Rina Dechter in 1986, [ 13 ] and to artificial neural networks by Igor Aizenberg and colleagues in 2000, in the context of Boolean threshold neurons. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Although the history of its appearance is apparently more complicated. [ 16 ] Interpretations [ edit source ] Deep neural networks are generally interpreted in terms of the universal approximation theorem [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] or probabilistic inference . [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 24 ] The classic universal approximation theorem concerns the capacity of feedforward neural networks with a single hidden layer of finite size to approximate continuous functions . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] In 1989, the first proof was published by George Cybenko for sigmoid activation functions [ 17 ] and was generalised to feed-forward multi-layer architectures in 1991 by Kurt Hornik. [ 18 ] Recent work also showed that universal approximation also holds for non-bounded activation functions such as Kunihiko Fukushima 's rectified linear unit . [ 25 ] [ 26 ] The universal approximation theorem for deep neural networks concerns the capacity of networks with bounded width but the depth is allowed to grow. Lu et al. [ 21 ] proved that if the width of a deep neural network with ReLU activation is strictly larger than the input dimension, then the network can approximate any Lebesgue integrable function ; if the width is smaller or equal to the input dimension, then a deep neural network is not a universal approximator. The probabilistic interpretation [ 24 ] derives from the field of machine learning . ", "strategy": "semantic"}

More specifically, the probabilistic interpretation considers the activation nonlinearity as a cumulative distribution function . [ 24 ] The probabilistic interpretation led to the introduction of dropout as regularizer in neural networks. The probabilistic interpretation was introduced by researchers including Hopfield , Widrow and Narendra and popularized in surveys such as the one by Bishop . [ 27 ] History [ edit source ] Before 1980 [ edit source ] There are two types of artificial neural network (ANN): feedforward neural network (FNN) or multilayer perceptron (MLP) and recurrent neural networks (RNN). RNNs have cycles in their connectivity structure, FNNs don't. In the 1920s, Wilhelm Lenz and Ernst Ising created the Ising model [ 28 ] [ 29 ] which is essentially a non-learning RNN architecture consisting of neuron-like threshold elements. In 1972, Shun'ichi Amari made this architecture adaptive. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 32 ] Other early recurrent neural networks were published by Kaoru Nakano in 1971. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Already in 1948, Alan Turing produced work on \"Intelligent Machinery\" that was not published in his lifetime, [ 35 ] containing \"ideas related to artificial evolution and learning RNNs\". [ 31 ] Frank Rosenblatt (1958) [ 36 ] proposed the perceptron, an MLP with 3 layers: an input layer, a hidden layer with randomized weights that did not learn, and an output layer. He later published a 1962 book that also introduced variants and computer experiments, including a version with four-layer perceptrons \"with adaptive preterminal networks\" where the last two layers have learned weights (here he credits H. D. Block and B. W. Knight). [ 37 ] : section 16 The book cites an earlier network by R. D. Joseph (1960) [ 38 ] \"functionally equivalent to a variation of\" this four-layer system (the book mentions Joseph over 30 times). Should Joseph therefore be considered the originator of proper adaptive multilayer perceptrons with learning hidden units? Unfortunately, the learning algorithm was not a functional one, and fell into oblivion. The first working deep learning algorithm was the Group method of data handling , a method to train arbitrarily deep neural networks, published by Alexey Ivakhnenko and Lapa in 1965. They regarded it as a form of polynomial regression, [ 39 ] or a generalization of Rosenblatt's perceptron to handle more complex, nonlinear, and hierarchical relationships. [ 40 ] A 1971 paper described a deep network with eight layers trained by this method, [ 41 ] which is based on layer by layer training through regression analysis. Superfluous hidden units are pruned using a separate validation set. Since the activation functions of the nodes are Kolmogorov-Gabor polynomials, these were also the first deep networks with multiplicative units or \"gates\". [ 31 ] The first deep learning multilayer perceptron trained by stochastic gradient descent [ 42 ] was published in 1967 by Shun'ichi Amari . [ 43 ] In computer experiments conducted by Amari's student Saito, a five layer MLP with two modifiable layers learned internal representations to classify non-linearily separable pattern classes. [ 31 ] Subsequent developments in hardware and hyperparameter tunings have made end-to-end stochastic gradient descent the currently dominant training technique. In 1969, Kunihiko Fukushima introduced the ReLU (rectified linear unit) activation function . [ 25 ] [ 31 ] The rectifier has become the most popular activation function for deep learning. [ 44 ] Deep learning architectures for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with convolutional layers and downsampling layers began with the Neocognitron introduced by Kunihiko Fukushima in 1979, though not trained by backpropagation. [ 45 ] [ 46 ] Backpropagation is an efficient application of the chain rule derived by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1673 [ 47 ] to networks of differentiable nodes. The terminology \"back-propagating errors\" was actually introduced in 1962 by Rosenblatt, [ 37 ] but he did not know how to implement this, although Henry J. Kelley had a continuous precursor of backpropagation in 1960 in the context of control theory .

[ 55 ] [ 56 ] 1980s-2000s [ edit source ] The time delay neural network (TDNN) was introduced in 1987 by Alex Waibel to apply CNN to phoneme recognition. It used convolutions, weight sharing, and backpropagation. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] In 1988, Wei Zhang applied a backpropagation-trained CNN to alphabet recognition. [ 59 ] In 1989, Yann LeCun et al. created a CNN called LeNet for recognizing handwritten ZIP codes on mail. Training required 3 days. [ 60 ] In 1990, Wei Zhang implemented a CNN on optical computing hardware. [ 61 ] In 1991, a CNN was applied to medical image object segmentation [ 62 ] and breast cancer detection in mammograms. [ 63 ] LeNet -5 (1998), a 7-level CNN by Yann LeCun et al., that classifies digits, was applied by several banks to recognize hand-written numbers on checks digitized in 32x32 pixel images. [ 64 ] Recurrent neural networks (RNN) [ 28 ] [ 30 ] were further developed in the 1980s. Recurrence is used for sequence processing, and when a recurrent network is unrolled, it mathematically resembles a deep feedforward layer. Consequently, they have similar properties and issues, and their developments had mutual influences. In RNN, two early influential works were the Jordan network (1986) [ 65 ] and the Elman network (1990), [ 66 ] which applied RNN to study problems in cognitive psychology . In the 1980s, backpropagation did not work well for deep learning with long credit assignment paths. To overcome this problem, in 1991, Jürgen Schmidhuber proposed a hierarchy of RNNs pre-trained one level at a time by self-supervised learning where each RNN tries to predict its own next input, which is the next unexpected input of the RNN below. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] This \"neural history compressor\" uses predictive coding to learn internal representations at multiple self-organizing time scales. This can substantially facilitate downstream deep learning. The RNN hierarchy can be collapsed into a single RNN, by distilling a higher level chunker network into a lower level automatizer network. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 31 ] In 1993, a neural history compressor solved a \"Very Deep Learning\" task that required more than 1000 subsequent layers in an RNN unfolded in time. [ 69 ] The \"P\" in ChatGPT refers to such pre-training. Sepp Hochreiter 's diploma thesis (1991) [ 70 ] implemented the neural history compressor, [ 67 ] and identified and analyzed the vanishing gradient problem . [ 70 ] [ 71 ] Hochreiter proposed recurrent residual connections to solve the vanishing gradient problem. This led to the long short-term memory (LSTM), published in 1995. [ 72 ] LSTM can learn \"very deep learning\" tasks [ 9 ] with long credit assignment paths that require memories of events that happened thousands of discrete time steps before. That LSTM was not yet the modern architecture, which required a \"forget gate\", introduced in 1999, [ 73 ] which became the standard RNN architecture. In 1991, Jürgen Schmidhuber also published adversarial neural networks that contest with each other in the form of a zero-sum game , where one network's gain is the other network's loss. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] The first network is a generative model that models a probability distribution over output patterns. The second network learns by gradient descent to predict the reactions of the environment to these patterns. This was called \"artificial curiosity\". In 2014, this principle was used in generative adversarial networks (GANs). [ 76 ] During 1985–1995, inspired by statistical mechanics, several architectures and methods were developed by Terry Sejnowski , Peter Dayan , Geoffrey Hinton , etc., including the Boltzmann machine , [ 77 ] restricted Boltzmann machine , [ 78 ] Helmholtz machine , [ 79 ] and the wake-sleep algorithm . [ 80 ] These were designed for unsupervised learning of deep generative models. However, those were more computationally expensive compared to backpropagation. Boltzmann machine learning algorithm, published in 1985, was briefly popular before being eclipsed by the backpropagation algorithm in 1986. (p. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

A 1988 network became state of the art in protein structure prediction , an early application of deep learning to bioinformatics. [ 82 ] Both shallow and deep learning (e.g., recurrent nets) of ANNs for speech recognition have been explored for many years. [ 83 ] [ 84 ] [ 85 ] These methods never outperformed non-uniform internal-handcrafting Gaussian mixture model / Hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) technology based on generative models of speech trained discriminatively. [ 86 ] Key difficulties have been analyzed, including gradient diminishing [ 70 ] and weak temporal correlation structure in neural predictive models. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] Additional difficulties were the lack of training data and limited computing power. Most speech recognition researchers moved away from neural nets to pursue generative modeling. An exception was at SRI International in the late 1990s. Funded by the US government's NSA and DARPA , SRI researched in speech and speaker recognition . The speaker recognition team led by Larry Heck reported significant success with deep neural networks in speech processing in the 1998 NIST Speaker Recognition benchmark. [ 89 ] [ 90 ] It was deployed in the Nuance Verifier, representing the first major industrial application of deep learning. [ 91 ] The principle of elevating \"raw\" features over hand-crafted optimization was first explored successfully in the architecture of deep autoencoder on the \"raw\" spectrogram or linear filter-bank features in the late 1990s, [ 90 ] showing its superiority over the Mel-Cepstral features that contain stages of fixed transformation from spectrograms. The raw features of speech, waveforms , later produced excellent larger-scale results. [ 92 ] 2000s [ edit source ] Neural networks entered a lull, and simpler models that use task-specific handcrafted features such as Gabor filters and support vector machines (SVMs) became the preferred choices in the 1990s and 2000s, because of artificial neural networks' computational cost and a lack of understanding of how the brain wires its biological networks. [ citation needed ] In 2003, LSTM became competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks. [ 93 ] In 2006, Alex Graves , Santiago Fernández, Faustino Gomez, and Schmidhuber combined it with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) [ 94 ] in stacks of LSTMs. [ 95 ] In 2009, it became the first RNN to win a pattern recognition contest, in connected handwriting recognition . [ 96 ] [ 9 ] In 2006, publications by Geoff Hinton , Ruslan Salakhutdinov , Osindero and Teh [ 97 ] [ 98 ] deep belief networks were developed for generative modeling. They are trained by training one restricted Boltzmann machine, then freezing it and training another one on top of the first one, and so on, then optionally fine-tuned using supervised backpropagation. [ 99 ] They could model high-dimensional probability distributions, such as the distribution of MNIST images , but convergence was slow. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] [ 102 ] The impact of deep learning in industry began in the early 2000s, when CNNs already processed an estimated 10% to 20% of all the checks written in the US, according to Yann LeCun. [ 103 ] Industrial applications of deep learning to large-scale speech recognition started around 2010. The 2009 NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning for Speech Recognition was motivated by the limitations of deep generative models of speech, and the possibility that given more capable hardware and large-scale data sets that deep neural nets might become practical. It was believed that pre-training DNNs using generative models of deep belief nets (DBN) would overcome the main difficulties of neural nets. However, it was discovered that replacing pre-training with large amounts of training data for straightforward backpropagation when using DNNs with large, context-dependent output layers produced error rates dramatically lower than then-state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture model (GMM)/Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and also than more-advanced generative model-based systems. [ 104 ] The nature of the recognition errors produced by the two types of systems was characteristically different, [ 105 ] offering technical insights into how to integrate deep learning into the existing highly efficient, run-time speech decoding system deployed by all major speech recognition systems. [ 23 ] [ 106 ] [ 107 ] Analysis around 2009–2010, contrasting the GMM (and other generative speech models) vs. DNN models, stimulated early industrial investment in deep learning for speech recognition. [ 105 ] That analysis was done with comparable performance (less than 1.5% in error rate) between discriminative DNNs and generative models. [ 104 ] [ 105 ] [ 108 ] In 2010, researchers extended deep learning from TIMIT to large vocabulary speech recognition, by adopting large output layers of the DNN based on context-dependent HMM states constructed by decision trees . [ 109 ] [ 110 ] [ 111 ] [ 106 ] Deep learning revolution [ edit source ] How deep learning is a subset of machine learning and how machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) The deep learning revolution started around CNN- and GPU-based computer vision. Although CNNs trained by backpropagation had been around for decades and GPU implementations of NNs for years, [ 112 ] including CNNs, [ 113 ] faster implementations of CNNs on GPUs were needed to progress on computer vision. Later, as deep learning becomes widespread, specialized hardware and algorithm optimizations were developed specifically for deep learning. [ 114 ] A key advance for the deep learning revolution was hardware advances, especially GPU. Some early work dated back to 2004. [ 112 ] [ 113 ] In 2009, Raina, Madhavan, and Andrew Ng reported a 100M deep belief network trained on 30 Nvidia GeForce GTX 280 GPUs, an early demonstration of GPU-based deep learning. They reported up to 70 times faster training. [ 115 ] In 2011, a CNN named DanNet [ 116 ] [ 117 ] by Dan Ciresan, Ueli Meier, Jonathan Masci, Luca Maria Gambardella , and Jürgen Schmidhuber achieved for the first time superhuman performance in a visual pattern recognition contest, outperforming traditional methods by a factor of 3. [ 9 ] It then won more contests. [ 118 ] [ 119 ] They also showed how max-pooling CNNs on GPU improved performance significantly. [ 3 ] In 2012, Andrew Ng and Jeff Dean created an FNN that learned to recognize higher-level concepts, such as cats, only from watching unlabeled images taken from YouTube videos. [ 120 ] In October 2012, AlexNet by Alex Krizhevsky , Ilya Sutskever , and Geoffrey Hinton [ 4 ] won the large-scale ImageNet competition by a significant margin over shallow machine learning methods. Further incremental improvements included the VGG-16 network by Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman [ 121 ] and Google's Inceptionv3 . [ 122 ] The success in image classification was then extended to the more challenging task of generating descriptions (captions) for images, often as a combination of CNNs and LSTMs. [ 123 ] [ 124 ] [ 125 ] In 2014, the state of the art was training “very deep neural network” with 20 to 30 layers.

[ 128 ] In 2015, two techniques were developed to train very deep networks: the Highway Network was published in May 2015, and the residual neural network (ResNet) [ 129 ] in Dec 2015. ResNet behaves like an open-gated Highway Net. Around the same time, deep learning started impacting the field of art. Early examples included Google DeepDream (2015), and neural style transfer (2015), [ 130 ] both of which were based on pretrained image classification neural networks, such as VGG-19 . Generative adversarial network (GAN) by ( Ian Goodfellow et al., 2014) [ 131 ] (based on Jürgen Schmidhuber 's principle of artificial curiosity [ 74 ] [ 76 ] ) became state of the art in generative modeling during 2014-2018 period. Excellent image quality is achieved by Nvidia 's StyleGAN (2018) [ 132 ] based on the Progressive GAN by Tero Karras et al. [ 133 ] Here the GAN generator is grown from small to large scale in a pyramidal fashion. Image generation by GAN reached popular success, and provoked discussions concerning deepfakes . [ 134 ] Diffusion models (2015) [ 135 ] eclipsed GANs in generative modeling since then, with systems such as DALL·E 2 (2022) and Stable Diffusion (2022). In 2015, Google's speech recognition improved by 49% by an LSTM-based model, which they made available through Google Voice Search on smartphone . [ 136 ] [ 137 ] Deep learning is part of state-of-the-art systems in various disciplines, particularly computer vision and automatic speech recognition (ASR). Results on commonly used evaluation sets such as TIMIT (ASR) and MNIST ( image classification ), as well as a range of large-vocabulary speech recognition tasks have steadily improved. [ 104 ] [ 138 ] Convolutional neural networks were superseded for ASR by LSTM . [ 137 ] [ 139 ] [ 140 ] [ 141 ] but are more successful in computer vision. Yoshua Bengio , Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun were awarded the 2018 Turing Award for \"conceptual and engineering breakthroughs that have made deep neural networks a critical component of computing\". [ 142 ] Neural networks [ edit source ] Main article: Artificial neural network Simplified example of training a neural network in object detection: The network is trained by multiple images that are known to depict starfish and sea urchins , which are correlated with \"nodes\" that represent visual features . The starfish match with a ringed texture and a star outline, whereas most sea urchins match with a striped texture and oval shape. However, the instance of a ring textured sea urchin creates a weakly weighted association between them. Subsequent run of the network on an input image (left): [ 143 ] The network correctly detects the starfish. However, the weakly weighted association between ringed texture and sea urchin also confers a weak signal to the latter from one of two intermediate nodes. In addition, a shell that was not included in the training gives a weak signal for the oval shape, also resulting in a weak signal for the sea urchin output. These weak signals may result in a false positive result for sea urchin. In reality, textures and outlines would not be represented by single nodes, but rather by associated weight patterns of multiple nodes. Artificial neural networks ( ANNs ) or connectionist systems are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems learn (progressively improve their ability) to do tasks by considering examples, generally without task-specific programming. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

They have found most use in applications difficult to express with a traditional computer algorithm using rule-based programming . An ANN is based on a collection of connected units called artificial neurons , (analogous to biological neurons in a biological brain ). Each connection ( synapse ) between neurons can transmit a signal to another neuron. The receiving (postsynaptic) neuron can process the signal(s) and then signal downstream neurons connected to it. Neurons may have state, generally represented by real numbers , typically between 0 and 1. Neurons and synapses may also have a weight that varies as learning proceeds, which can increase or decrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream. Typically, neurons are organized in layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first (input), to the last (output) layer, possibly after traversing the layers multiple times. The original goal of the neural network approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. Over time, attention focused on matching specific mental abilities, leading to deviations from biology such as backpropagation , or passing information in the reverse direction and adjusting the network to reflect that information. Neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition , machine translation , social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis. As of 2017, neural networks typically have a few thousand to a few million units and millions of connections. Despite this number being several order of magnitude less than the number of neurons on a human brain, these networks can perform many tasks at a level beyond that of humans (e.g., recognizing faces, or playing \"Go\" [ 144 ] ). Deep neural networks [ edit source ] A deep neural network (DNN) is an artificial neural network with multiple layers between the input and output layers. [ 7 ] [ 9 ] There are different types of neural networks but they always consist of the same components: neurons, synapses, weights, biases, and functions. [ 145 ] These components as a whole function in a way that mimics functions of the human brain, and can be trained like any other ML algorithm. [ citation needed ] For example, a DNN that is trained to recognize dog breeds will go over the given image and calculate the probability that the dog in the image is a certain breed. The user can review the results and select which probabilities the network should display (above a certain threshold, etc.) and return the proposed label. Each mathematical manipulation as such is considered a layer, [ 146 ] and complex DNN have many layers, hence the name \"deep\" networks. DNNs can model complex non-linear relationships. DNN architectures generate compositional models where the object is expressed as a layered composition of primitives . [ 147 ] The extra layers enable composition of features from lower layers, potentially modeling complex data with fewer units than a similarly performing shallow network. [ 7 ] For instance, it was proved that sparse multivariate polynomials are exponentially easier to approximate with DNNs than with shallow networks. [ 148 ] Deep architectures include many variants of a few basic approaches. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

The weights and inputs are multiplied and return an output between 0 and 1. If the network did not accurately recognize a particular pattern, an algorithm would adjust the weights. [ 149 ] That way the algorithm can make certain parameters more influential, until it determines the correct mathematical manipulation to fully process the data. Recurrent neural networks , in which data can flow in any direction, are used for applications such as language modeling . [ 150 ] [ 151 ] [ 152 ] [ 153 ] [ 154 ] Long short-term memory is particularly effective for this use. [ 155 ] [ 156 ] Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used in computer vision. [ 157 ] CNNs also have been applied to acoustic modeling for automatic speech recognition (ASR). [ 158 ] Challenges [ edit source ] As with ANNs, many issues can arise with naively trained DNNs. Two common issues are overfitting and computation time. DNNs are prone to overfitting because of the added layers of abstraction, which allow them to model rare dependencies in the training data. Regularization methods such as Ivakhnenko's unit pruning [ 41 ] or weight decay ( ℓ 2 {\\displaystyle \\ell _{2}} -regularization) or sparsity ( ℓ 1 {\\displaystyle \\ell _{1}} -regularization) can be applied during training to combat overfitting.

This approach has been successfully applied for multivariate time series prediction tasks such as traffic prediction. [ 161 ] Finally, data can be augmented via methods such as cropping and rotating such that smaller training sets can be increased in size to reduce the chances of overfitting. [ 162 ] DNNs must consider many training parameters, such as the size (number of layers and number of units per layer), the learning rate , and initial weights. Sweeping through the parameter space for optimal parameters may not be feasible due to the cost in time and computational resources. Various tricks, such as batching (computing the gradient on several training examples at once rather than individual examples) [ 163 ] speed up computation. Large processing capabilities of many-core architectures (such as GPUs or the Intel Xeon Phi) have produced significant speedups in training, because of the suitability of such processing architectures for the matrix and vector computations. [ 164 ] [ 165 ] Alternatively, engineers may look for other types of neural networks with more straightforward and convergent training algorithms. CMAC ( cerebellar model articulation controller ) is one such kind of neural network. It doesn't require learning rates or randomized initial weights. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 168 ] By 2019, graphics processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method for training large-scale commercial cloud AI . [ 169 ] OpenAI estimated the hardware computation used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017) and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of computation required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months. [ 170 ] [ 171 ] Special electronic circuits called deep learning processors were designed to speed up deep learning algorithms. Deep learning processors include neural processing units (NPUs) in Huawei cellphones [ 172 ] and cloud computing servers such as tensor processing units (TPU) in the Google Cloud Platform . [ 173 ] Cerebras Systems has also built a dedicated system to handle large deep learning models, the CS-2, based on the largest processor in the industry, the second-generation Wafer Scale Engine (WSE-2). [ 174 ] [ 175 ] Atomically thin semiconductors are considered promising for energy-efficient deep learning hardware where the same basic device structure is used for both logic operations and data storage. In 2020, Marega et al. published experiments with a large-area active channel material for developing logic-in-memory devices and circuits based on floating-gate field-effect transistors (FGFETs). [ 176 ] In 2021, J. Feldmann et al. proposed an integrated photonic hardware accelerator for parallel convolutional processing. [ 177 ] The authors identify two key advantages of integrated photonics over its electronic counterparts: (1) massively parallel data transfer through wavelength division multiplexing in conjunction with frequency combs , and (2) extremely high data modulation speeds. [ 177 ] Their system can execute trillions of multiply-accumulate operations per second, indicating the potential of integrated photonics in data-heavy AI applications.

LSTM RNNs can learn \"Very Deep Learning\" tasks [ 9 ] that involve multi-second intervals containing speech events separated by thousands of discrete time steps, where one time step corresponds to about 10 ms. LSTM with forget gates [ 156 ] is competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks. [ 93 ] The initial success in speech recognition was based on small-scale recognition tasks based on TIMIT. The data set contains 630 speakers from eight major dialects of American English , where each speaker reads 10 sentences. [ 178 ] Its small size lets many configurations be tried. More importantly, the TIMIT task concerns phone -sequence recognition, which, unlike word-sequence recognition, allows weak phone bigram language models. This lets the strength of the acoustic modeling aspects of speech recognition be more easily analyzed.

[ 221 ] [ 222 ] Customer relationship management [ edit source ] Main article: Customer relationship management Deep reinforcement learning has been used to approximate the value of possible direct marketing actions, defined in terms of RFM variables. The estimated value function was shown to have a natural interpretation as customer lifetime value . [ 223 ] Recommendation systems [ edit source ] Main article: Recommender system Recommendation systems have used deep learning to extract meaningful features for a latent factor model for content-based music and journal recommendations. [ 224 ] [ 225 ] Multi-view deep learning has been applied for learning user preferences from multiple domains. [ 226 ] The model uses a hybrid collaborative and content-based approach and enhances recommendations in multiple tasks. Bioinformatics [ edit source ] Main article: Bioinformatics An autoencoder ANN was used in bioinformatics , to predict gene ontology annotations and gene-function relationships. [ 227 ] In medical informatics, deep learning was used to predict sleep quality based on data from wearables [ 228 ] and predictions of health complications from electronic health record data. [ 229 ] Deep neural networks have shown unparalleled performance in predicting protein structure , according to the sequence of the amino acids that make it up. In 2020, AlphaFold , a deep-learning based system, achieved a level of accuracy significantly higher than all previous computational methods. [ 230 ] [ 231 ] Deep Neural Network Estimations [ edit source ] Deep neural networks can be used to estimate the entropy of a stochastic process and called Neural Joint Entropy Estimator (NJEE). [ 232 ] Such an estimation provides insights on the effects of input random variables on an independent random variable . Practically, the DNN is trained as a classifier that maps an input vector or matrix X to an output probability distribution over the possible classes of random variable Y, given input X. For example, in image classification tasks, the NJEE maps a vector of pixels ' color values to probabilities over possible image classes. In practice, the probability distribution of Y is obtained by a Softmax layer with number of nodes that is equal to the alphabet size of Y. NJEE uses continuously differentiable activation functions , such that the conditions for the universal approximation theorem holds. It is shown that this method provides a strongly consistent estimator and outperforms other methods in case of large alphabet sizes. [ 232 ] Medical image analysis [ edit source ] Deep learning has been shown to produce competitive results in medical application such as cancer cell classification, lesion detection, organ segmentation and image enhancement. [ 233 ] [ 234 ] Modern deep learning tools demonstrate the high accuracy of detecting various diseases and the helpfulness of their use by specialists to improve the diagnosis efficiency. [ 235 ] [ 236 ] Mobile advertising [ edit source ] Finding the appropriate mobile audience for mobile advertising is always challenging, since many data points must be considered and analyzed before a target segment can be created and used in ad serving by any ad server. [ 237 ] Deep learning has been used to interpret large, many-dimensioned advertising datasets. Many data points are collected during the request/serve/click internet advertising cycle. This information can form the basis of machine learning to improve ad selection. Image restoration [ edit source ] Deep learning has been successfully applied to inverse problems such as denoising , super-resolution , inpainting , and film colorization . [ 238 ] These applications include learning methods such as \"Shrinkage Fields for Effective Image Restoration\" [ 239 ] which trains on an image dataset, and Deep Image Prior , which trains on the image that needs restoration. Financial fraud detection [ edit source ] Deep learning is being successfully applied to financial fraud detection , tax evasion detection, [ 240 ] and anti-money laundering. [ 241 ] Materials science [ edit source ] In November 2023, researchers at Google DeepMind and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory announced that they had developed an AI system known as GNoME. This system has contributed to materials science by discovering over 2 million new materials within a relatively short timeframe. GNoME employs deep learning techniques to efficiently explore potential material structures, achieving a significant increase in the identification of stable inorganic crystal structures . The system's predictions were validated through autonomous robotic experiments, demonstrating a noteworthy success rate of 71%. The data of newly discovered materials is publicly available through the Materials Project database, offering researchers the opportunity to identify materials with desired properties for various applications. This development has implications for the future of scientific discovery and the integration of AI in material science research, potentially expediting material innovation and reducing costs in product development. The use of AI and deep learning suggests the possibility of minimizing or eliminating manual lab experiments and allowing scientists to focus more on the design and analysis of unique compounds. [ 242 ] [ 243 ] [ 244 ] Military [ edit source ] The United States Department of Defense applied deep learning to train robots in new tasks through observation. [ 245 ] Partial differential equations [ edit source ] Physics informed neural networks have been used to solve partial differential equations in both forward and inverse problems in a data driven manner. [ 246 ] One example is the reconstructing fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equations . Using physics informed neural networks does not require the often expensive mesh generation that conventional CFD methods rely on. [ 247 ] [ 248 ] Deep backward stochastic differential equation method [ edit source ] Deep backward stochastic differential equation method is a numerical method that combines deep learning with Backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE). This method is particularly useful for solving high-dimensional problems in financial mathematics. By leveraging the powerful function approximation capabilities of deep neural networks , deep BSDE addresses the computational challenges faced by traditional numerical methods in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, traditional methods like finite difference methods or Monte Carlo simulations often struggle with the curse of dimensionality, where computational cost increases exponentially with the number of dimensions. Deep BSDE methods, however, employ deep neural networks to approximate solutions of high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), effectively reducing the computational burden. [ 249 ] In addition, the integration of Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) into the deep BSDE framework enhances its capability by embedding the underlying physical laws directly into the neural network architecture. This ensures that the solutions not only fit the data but also adhere to the governing stochastic differential equations. PINNs leverage the power of deep learning while respecting the constraints imposed by the physical models, resulting in more accurate and reliable solutions for financial mathematics problems. Image reconstruction [ edit source ] Image reconstruction is the reconstruction of the underlying images from the image-related measurements. Several works showed the better and superior performance of the deep learning methods compared to analytical methods for various applications, e.g., spectral imaging [ 250 ] and ultrasound imaging. [ 251 ] Weather prediction [ edit source ] Traditional weather prediction systems solve a very complex system of partial differential equations. GraphCast is a deep learning based model, trained on a long history of weather data to predict how weather patterns change over time. It is able to predict weather conditions for up to 10 days globally, at a very detailed level, and in under a minute, with precision similar to state of the art systems. [ 252 ] [ 253 ] Epigenetic clock [ edit source ] Main article: Epigenetic clock An epigenetic clock is a biochemical test that can be used to measure age. Galkin et al. used deep neural networks to train an epigenetic aging clock of unprecedented accuracy using >6,000 blood samples. [ 254 ] The clock uses information from 1000 CpG sites and predicts people with certain conditions older than healthy controls: IBD , frontotemporal dementia , ovarian cancer , obesity . The aging clock was planned to be released for public use in 2021 by an Insilico Medicine spinoff company Deep Longevity. Relation to human cognitive and brain development [ edit source ] Deep learning is closely related to a class of theories of brain development (specifically, neocortical development) proposed by cognitive neuroscientists in the early 1990s. [ 255 ] [ 256 ] [ 257 ] [ 258 ] These developmental theories were instantiated in computational models, making them predecessors of deep learning systems. These developmental models share the property that various proposed learning dynamics in the brain (e.g., a wave of nerve growth factor ) support the self-organization somewhat analogous to the neural networks utilized in deep learning models. Like the neocortex , neural networks employ a hierarchy of layered filters in which each layer considers information from a prior layer (or the operating environment), and then passes its output (and possibly the original input), to other layers. This process yields a self-organizing stack of transducers , well-tuned to their operating environment. A 1995 description stated, \"...the infant's brain seems to organize itself under the influence of waves of so-called trophic-factors ... different regions of the brain become connected sequentially, with one layer of tissue maturing before another and so on until the whole brain is mature\". [ 259 ] A variety of approaches have been used to investigate the plausibility of deep learning models from a neurobiological perspective. On the one hand, several variants of the backpropagation algorithm have been proposed in order to increase its processing realism. [ 260 ] [ 261 ] Other researchers have argued that unsupervised forms of deep learning, such as those based on hierarchical generative models and deep belief networks , may be closer to biological reality. [ 262 ] [ 263 ] In this respect, generative neural network models have been related to neurobiological evidence about sampling-based processing in the cerebral cortex. [ 264 ] Although a systematic comparison between the human brain organization and the neuronal encoding in deep networks has not yet been established, several analogies have been reported. For example, the computations performed by deep learning units could be similar to those of actual neurons [ 265 ] and neural populations. [ 266 ] Similarly, the representations developed by deep learning models are similar to those measured in the primate visual system [ 267 ] both at the single-unit [ 268 ] and at the population [ 269 ] levels.", "strategy": "semantic"}

The adjective \"deep\" refers to the use of multiple layers (ranging from three to several hundred or thousands) in the network. Methods used can be supervised , semi-supervised or unsupervised . [ 2 ] Some common deep learning network architectures include fully connected networks , deep belief networks , recurrent neural networks , convolutional neural networks , generative adversarial networks , transformers , and neural radiance fields . These architectures have been applied to fields including computer vision , speech recognition , natural language processing , machine translation , bioinformatics , drug design , medical image analysis , climate science , material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Early forms of neural networks were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems , particularly the human brain . However, current neural networks do not intend to model the brain function of organisms, and are generally seen as low-quality models for that purpose. [ 6 ] Overview [ edit source ] Most modern deep learning models are based on multi-layered neural networks such as convolutional neural networks and transformers , although they can also include propositional formulas or latent variables organized layer-wise in deep generative models such as the nodes in deep belief networks and deep Boltzmann machines . [ 7 ] Fundamentally, deep learning refers to a class of machine learning algorithms in which a hierarchy of layers is used to transform input data into a progressively more abstract and composite representation. For example, in an image recognition model, the raw input may be an image (represented as a tensor of pixels ). The first representational layer may attempt to identify basic shapes such as lines and circles, the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges, the third layer may encode a nose and eyes, and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains a face. Importantly, a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place at which level on its own . Prior to deep learning, machine learning techniques often involved hand-crafted feature engineering to transform the data into a more suitable representation for a classification algorithm to operate on. In the deep learning approach, features are not hand-crafted and the model discovers useful feature representations from the data automatically. This does not eliminate the need for hand-tuning; for example, varying numbers of layers and layer sizes can provide different degrees of abstraction. [ 8 ] [ 2 ] The word \"deep\" in \"deep learning\" refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed. More precisely, deep learning systems have a substantial credit assignment path (CAP) depth. The CAP is the chain of transformations from input to output. CAPs describe potentially causal connections between input and output. For a feedforward neural network , the depth of the CAPs is that of the network and is the number of hidden layers plus one (as the output layer is also parameterized). For recurrent neural networks , in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once, the CAP depth is potentially unlimited. [ 9 ] No universally agreed-upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning, but most researchers agree that deep learning involves CAP depth higher than two. CAP of depth two has been shown to be a universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function. [ 10 ] Beyond that, more layers do not add to the function approximator ability of the network. Deep models (CAP > two) are able to extract better features than shallow models and hence, extra layers help in learning the features effectively. Deep learning architectures can be constructed with a greedy layer-by-layer method. [ 11 ] Deep learning helps to disentangle these abstractions and pick out which features improve performance. [ 8 ] Deep learning algorithms can be applied to unsupervised learning tasks. This is an important benefit because unlabeled data is more abundant than the labeled data. Examples of deep structures that can be trained in an unsupervised manner are deep belief networks . [ 8 ] [ 12 ] The term deep learning was introduced to the machine learning community by Rina Dechter in 1986, [ 13 ] and to artificial neural networks by Igor Aizenberg and colleagues in 2000, in the context of Boolean threshold neurons. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Although the history of its appearance is apparently more complicated. [ 16 ] Interpretations [ edit source ] Deep neural networks are generally interpreted in terms of the universal approximation theorem [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] or probabilistic inference . [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 24 ] The classic universal approximation theorem concerns the capacity of feedforward neural networks with a single hidden layer of finite size to approximate continuous functions . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] In 1989, the first proof was published by George Cybenko for sigmoid activation functions [ 17 ] and was generalised to feed-forward multi-layer architectures in 1991 by Kurt Hornik. [ 18 ] Recent work also showed that universal approximation also holds for non-bounded activation functions such as Kunihiko Fukushima 's rectified linear unit . [ 25 ] [ 26 ] The universal approximation theorem for deep neural networks concerns the capacity of networks with bounded width but the depth is allowed to grow. Lu et al. [ 21 ] proved that if the width of a deep neural network with ReLU activation is strictly larger than the input dimension, then the network can approximate any Lebesgue integrable function ; if the width is smaller or equal to the input dimension, then a deep neural network is not a universal approximator. The probabilistic interpretation [ 24 ] derives from the field of machine learning . ", "strategy": "semantic"}

More specifically, the probabilistic interpretation considers the activation nonlinearity as a cumulative distribution function . [ 24 ] The probabilistic interpretation led to the introduction of dropout as regularizer in neural networks. The probabilistic interpretation was introduced by researchers including Hopfield , Widrow and Narendra and popularized in surveys such as the one by Bishop . [ 27 ] History [ edit source ] Before 1980 [ edit source ] There are two types of artificial neural network (ANN): feedforward neural network (FNN) or multilayer perceptron (MLP) and recurrent neural networks (RNN). RNNs have cycles in their connectivity structure, FNNs don't. In the 1920s, Wilhelm Lenz and Ernst Ising created the Ising model [ 28 ] [ 29 ] which is essentially a non-learning RNN architecture consisting of neuron-like threshold elements. In 1972, Shun'ichi Amari made this architecture adaptive. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 32 ] Other early recurrent neural networks were published by Kaoru Nakano in 1971. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Already in 1948, Alan Turing produced work on \"Intelligent Machinery\" that was not published in his lifetime, [ 35 ] containing \"ideas related to artificial evolution and learning RNNs\". [ 31 ] Frank Rosenblatt (1958) [ 36 ] proposed the perceptron, an MLP with 3 layers: an input layer, a hidden layer with randomized weights that did not learn, and an output layer. He later published a 1962 book that also introduced variants and computer experiments, including a version with four-layer perceptrons \"with adaptive preterminal networks\" where the last two layers have learned weights (here he credits H. D. Block and B. W. Knight). [ 37 ] : section 16 The book cites an earlier network by R. D. Joseph (1960) [ 38 ] \"functionally equivalent to a variation of\" this four-layer system (the book mentions Joseph over 30 times). Should Joseph therefore be considered the originator of proper adaptive multilayer perceptrons with learning hidden units? Unfortunately, the learning algorithm was not a functional one, and fell into oblivion. The first working deep learning algorithm was the Group method of data handling , a method to train arbitrarily deep neural networks, published by Alexey Ivakhnenko and Lapa in 1965. They regarded it as a form of polynomial regression, [ 39 ] or a generalization of Rosenblatt's perceptron to handle more complex, nonlinear, and hierarchical relationships. [ 40 ] A 1971 paper described a deep network with eight layers trained by this method, [ 41 ] which is based on layer by layer training through regression analysis. Superfluous hidden units are pruned using a separate validation set. Since the activation functions of the nodes are Kolmogorov-Gabor polynomials, these were also the first deep networks with multiplicative units or \"gates\". [ 31 ] The first deep learning multilayer perceptron trained by stochastic gradient descent [ 42 ] was published in 1967 by Shun'ichi Amari . [ 43 ] In computer experiments conducted by Amari's student Saito, a five layer MLP with two modifiable layers learned internal representations to classify non-linearily separable pattern classes. [ 31 ] Subsequent developments in hardware and hyperparameter tunings have made end-to-end stochastic gradient descent the currently dominant training technique. In 1969, Kunihiko Fukushima introduced the ReLU (rectified linear unit) activation function . [ 25 ] [ 31 ] The rectifier has become the most popular activation function for deep learning. [ 44 ] Deep learning architectures for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with convolutional layers and downsampling layers began with the Neocognitron introduced by Kunihiko Fukushima in 1979, though not trained by backpropagation. [ 45 ] [ 46 ] Backpropagation is an efficient application of the chain rule derived by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1673 [ 47 ] to networks of differentiable nodes. The terminology \"back-propagating errors\" was actually introduced in 1962 by Rosenblatt, [ 37 ] but he did not know how to implement this, although Henry J. Kelley had a continuous precursor of backpropagation in 1960 in the context of control theory . [ 48 ] The modern form of backpropagation was first published in Seppo Linnainmaa 's master thesis (1970). [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 31 ] G.M. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 55 ] [ 56 ] 1980s-2000s [ edit source ] The time delay neural network (TDNN) was introduced in 1987 by Alex Waibel to apply CNN to phoneme recognition. It used convolutions, weight sharing, and backpropagation. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] In 1988, Wei Zhang applied a backpropagation-trained CNN to alphabet recognition. [ 59 ] In 1989, Yann LeCun et al. created a CNN called LeNet for recognizing handwritten ZIP codes on mail. Training required 3 days. [ 60 ] In 1990, Wei Zhang implemented a CNN on optical computing hardware. [ 61 ] In 1991, a CNN was applied to medical image object segmentation [ 62 ] and breast cancer detection in mammograms. [ 63 ] LeNet -5 (1998), a 7-level CNN by Yann LeCun et al., that classifies digits, was applied by several banks to recognize hand-written numbers on checks digitized in 32x32 pixel images. [ 64 ] Recurrent neural networks (RNN) [ 28 ] [ 30 ] were further developed in the 1980s. Recurrence is used for sequence processing, and when a recurrent network is unrolled, it mathematically resembles a deep feedforward layer. Consequently, they have similar properties and issues, and their developments had mutual influences. In RNN, two early influential works were the Jordan network (1986) [ 65 ] and the Elman network (1990), [ 66 ] which applied RNN to study problems in cognitive psychology . In the 1980s, backpropagation did not work well for deep learning with long credit assignment paths. To overcome this problem, in 1991, Jürgen Schmidhuber proposed a hierarchy of RNNs pre-trained one level at a time by self-supervised learning where each RNN tries to predict its own next input, which is the next unexpected input of the RNN below. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] This \"neural history compressor\" uses predictive coding to learn internal representations at multiple self-organizing time scales. This can substantially facilitate downstream deep learning. The RNN hierarchy can be collapsed into a single RNN, by distilling a higher level chunker network into a lower level automatizer network. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 31 ] In 1993, a neural history compressor solved a \"Very Deep Learning\" task that required more than 1000 subsequent layers in an RNN unfolded in time. [ 69 ] The \"P\" in ChatGPT refers to such pre-training. Sepp Hochreiter 's diploma thesis (1991) [ 70 ] implemented the neural history compressor, [ 67 ] and identified and analyzed the vanishing gradient problem . [ 70 ] [ 71 ] Hochreiter proposed recurrent residual connections to solve the vanishing gradient problem. This led to the long short-term memory (LSTM), published in 1995. [ 72 ] LSTM can learn \"very deep learning\" tasks [ 9 ] with long credit assignment paths that require memories of events that happened thousands of discrete time steps before. That LSTM was not yet the modern architecture, which required a \"forget gate\", introduced in 1999, [ 73 ] which became the standard RNN architecture. In 1991, Jürgen Schmidhuber also published adversarial neural networks that contest with each other in the form of a zero-sum game , where one network's gain is the other network's loss. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] The first network is a generative model that models a probability distribution over output patterns. The second network learns by gradient descent to predict the reactions of the environment to these patterns. This was called \"artificial curiosity\". In 2014, this principle was used in generative adversarial networks (GANs). [ 76 ] During 1985–1995, inspired by statistical mechanics, several architectures and methods were developed by Terry Sejnowski , Peter Dayan , Geoffrey Hinton , etc., including the Boltzmann machine , [ 77 ] restricted Boltzmann machine , [ 78 ] Helmholtz machine , [ 79 ] and the wake-sleep algorithm . [ 80 ] These were designed for unsupervised learning of deep generative models. However, those were more computationally expensive compared to backpropagation. Boltzmann machine learning algorithm, published in 1985, was briefly popular before being eclipsed by the backpropagation algorithm in 1986. (p. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

A 1988 network became state of the art in protein structure prediction , an early application of deep learning to bioinformatics. [ 82 ] Both shallow and deep learning (e.g., recurrent nets) of ANNs for speech recognition have been explored for many years. [ 83 ] [ 84 ] [ 85 ] These methods never outperformed non-uniform internal-handcrafting Gaussian mixture model / Hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) technology based on generative models of speech trained discriminatively. [ 86 ] Key difficulties have been analyzed, including gradient diminishing [ 70 ] and weak temporal correlation structure in neural predictive models. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] Additional difficulties were the lack of training data and limited computing power. Most speech recognition researchers moved away from neural nets to pursue generative modeling. An exception was at SRI International in the late 1990s. Funded by the US government's NSA and DARPA , SRI researched in speech and speaker recognition . The speaker recognition team led by Larry Heck reported significant success with deep neural networks in speech processing in the 1998 NIST Speaker Recognition benchmark. [ 89 ] [ 90 ] It was deployed in the Nuance Verifier, representing the first major industrial application of deep learning. [ 91 ] The principle of elevating \"raw\" features over hand-crafted optimization was first explored successfully in the architecture of deep autoencoder on the \"raw\" spectrogram or linear filter-bank features in the late 1990s, [ 90 ] showing its superiority over the Mel-Cepstral features that contain stages of fixed transformation from spectrograms. The raw features of speech, waveforms , later produced excellent larger-scale results. [ 92 ] 2000s [ edit source ] Neural networks entered a lull, and simpler models that use task-specific handcrafted features such as Gabor filters and support vector machines (SVMs) became the preferred choices in the 1990s and 2000s, because of artificial neural networks' computational cost and a lack of understanding of how the brain wires its biological networks. [ citation needed ] In 2003, LSTM became competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks. [ 93 ] In 2006, Alex Graves , Santiago Fernández, Faustino Gomez, and Schmidhuber combined it with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) [ 94 ] in stacks of LSTMs. [ 95 ] In 2009, it became the first RNN to win a pattern recognition contest, in connected handwriting recognition . [ 96 ] [ 9 ] In 2006, publications by Geoff Hinton , Ruslan Salakhutdinov , Osindero and Teh [ 97 ] [ 98 ] deep belief networks were developed for generative modeling. They are trained by training one restricted Boltzmann machine, then freezing it and training another one on top of the first one, and so on, then optionally fine-tuned using supervised backpropagation. [ 99 ] They could model high-dimensional probability distributions, such as the distribution of MNIST images , but convergence was slow. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] [ 102 ] The impact of deep learning in industry began in the early 2000s, when CNNs already processed an estimated 10% to 20% of all the checks written in the US, according to Yann LeCun. [ 103 ] Industrial applications of deep learning to large-scale speech recognition started around 2010. The 2009 NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning for Speech Recognition was motivated by the limitations of deep generative models of speech, and the possibility that given more capable hardware and large-scale data sets that deep neural nets might become practical. It was believed that pre-training DNNs using generative models of deep belief nets (DBN) would overcome the main difficulties of neural nets. However, it was discovered that replacing pre-training with large amounts of training data for straightforward backpropagation when using DNNs with large, context-dependent output layers produced error rates dramatically lower than then-state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture model (GMM)/Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and also than more-advanced generative model-based systems. [ 104 ] The nature of the recognition errors produced by the two types of systems was characteristically different, [ 105 ] offering technical insights into how to integrate deep learning into the existing highly efficient, run-time speech decoding system deployed by all major speech recognition systems. [ 23 ] [ 106 ] [ 107 ] Analysis around 2009–2010, contrasting the GMM (and other generative speech models) vs. DNN models, stimulated early industrial investment in deep learning for speech recognition. [ 105 ] That analysis was done with comparable performance (less than 1.5% in error rate) between discriminative DNNs and generative models. [ 104 ] [ 105 ] [ 108 ] In 2010, researchers extended deep learning from TIMIT to large vocabulary speech recognition, by adopting large output layers of the DNN based on context-dependent HMM states constructed by decision trees . [ 109 ] [ 110 ] [ 111 ] [ 106 ] Deep learning revolution [ edit source ] How deep learning is a subset of machine learning and how machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) The deep learning revolution started around CNN- and GPU-based computer vision. Although CNNs trained by backpropagation had been around for decades and GPU implementations of NNs for years, [ 112 ] including CNNs, [ 113 ] faster implementations of CNNs on GPUs were needed to progress on computer vision. Later, as deep learning becomes widespread, specialized hardware and algorithm optimizations were developed specifically for deep learning. [ 114 ] A key advance for the deep learning revolution was hardware advances, especially GPU. Some early work dated back to 2004. [ 112 ] [ 113 ] In 2009, Raina, Madhavan, and Andrew Ng reported a 100M deep belief network trained on 30 Nvidia GeForce GTX 280 GPUs, an early demonstration of GPU-based deep learning. They reported up to 70 times faster training. [ 115 ] In 2011, a CNN named DanNet [ 116 ] [ 117 ] by Dan Ciresan, Ueli Meier, Jonathan Masci, Luca Maria Gambardella , and Jürgen Schmidhuber achieved for the first time superhuman performance in a visual pattern recognition contest, outperforming traditional methods by a factor of 3. [ 9 ] It then won more contests. [ 118 ] [ 119 ] They also showed how max-pooling CNNs on GPU improved performance significantly. [ 3 ] In 2012, Andrew Ng and Jeff Dean created an FNN that learned to recognize higher-level concepts, such as cats, only from watching unlabeled images taken from YouTube videos. [ 120 ] In October 2012, AlexNet by Alex Krizhevsky , Ilya Sutskever , and Geoffrey Hinton [ 4 ] won the large-scale ImageNet competition by a significant margin over shallow machine learning methods. Further incremental improvements included the VGG-16 network by Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman [ 121 ] and Google's Inceptionv3 . [ 122 ] The success in image classification was then extended to the more challenging task of generating descriptions (captions) for images, often as a combination of CNNs and LSTMs. [ 123 ] [ 124 ] [ 125 ] In 2014, the state of the art was training “very deep neural network” with 20 to 30 layers.

[ 128 ] In 2015, two techniques were developed to train very deep networks: the Highway Network was published in May 2015, and the residual neural network (ResNet) [ 129 ] in Dec 2015. ResNet behaves like an open-gated Highway Net. Around the same time, deep learning started impacting the field of art. Early examples included Google DeepDream (2015), and neural style transfer (2015), [ 130 ] both of which were based on pretrained image classification neural networks, such as VGG-19 . Generative adversarial network (GAN) by ( Ian Goodfellow et al., 2014) [ 131 ] (based on Jürgen Schmidhuber 's principle of artificial curiosity [ 74 ] [ 76 ] ) became state of the art in generative modeling during 2014-2018 period. Excellent image quality is achieved by Nvidia 's StyleGAN (2018) [ 132 ] based on the Progressive GAN by Tero Karras et al. [ 133 ] Here the GAN generator is grown from small to large scale in a pyramidal fashion. Image generation by GAN reached popular success, and provoked discussions concerning deepfakes . [ 134 ] Diffusion models (2015) [ 135 ] eclipsed GANs in generative modeling since then, with systems such as DALL·E 2 (2022) and Stable Diffusion (2022). In 2015, Google's speech recognition improved by 49% by an LSTM-based model, which they made available through Google Voice Search on smartphone . [ 136 ] [ 137 ] Deep learning is part of state-of-the-art systems in various disciplines, particularly computer vision and automatic speech recognition (ASR). Results on commonly used evaluation sets such as TIMIT (ASR) and MNIST ( image classification ), as well as a range of large-vocabulary speech recognition tasks have steadily improved. [ 104 ] [ 138 ] Convolutional neural networks were superseded for ASR by LSTM . [ 137 ] [ 139 ] [ 140 ] [ 141 ] but are more successful in computer vision. Yoshua Bengio , Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun were awarded the 2018 Turing Award for \"conceptual and engineering breakthroughs that have made deep neural networks a critical component of computing\". [ 142 ] Neural networks [ edit source ] Main article: Artificial neural network Simplified example of training a neural network in object detection: The network is trained by multiple images that are known to depict starfish and sea urchins , which are correlated with \"nodes\" that represent visual features . The starfish match with a ringed texture and a star outline, whereas most sea urchins match with a striped texture and oval shape. However, the instance of a ring textured sea urchin creates a weakly weighted association between them. Subsequent run of the network on an input image (left): [ 143 ] The network correctly detects the starfish. However, the weakly weighted association between ringed texture and sea urchin also confers a weak signal to the latter from one of two intermediate nodes. In addition, a shell that was not included in the training gives a weak signal for the oval shape, also resulting in a weak signal for the sea urchin output. These weak signals may result in a false positive result for sea urchin. In reality, textures and outlines would not be represented by single nodes, but rather by associated weight patterns of multiple nodes. Artificial neural networks ( ANNs ) or connectionist systems are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems learn (progressively improve their ability) to do tasks by considering examples, generally without task-specific programming. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

They have found most use in applications difficult to express with a traditional computer algorithm using rule-based programming . An ANN is based on a collection of connected units called artificial neurons , (analogous to biological neurons in a biological brain ). Each connection ( synapse ) between neurons can transmit a signal to another neuron. The receiving (postsynaptic) neuron can process the signal(s) and then signal downstream neurons connected to it. Neurons may have state, generally represented by real numbers , typically between 0 and 1. Neurons and synapses may also have a weight that varies as learning proceeds, which can increase or decrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream. Typically, neurons are organized in layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first (input), to the last (output) layer, possibly after traversing the layers multiple times. The original goal of the neural network approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. Over time, attention focused on matching specific mental abilities, leading to deviations from biology such as backpropagation , or passing information in the reverse direction and adjusting the network to reflect that information. Neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition , machine translation , social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis. As of 2017, neural networks typically have a few thousand to a few million units and millions of connections. Despite this number being several order of magnitude less than the number of neurons on a human brain, these networks can perform many tasks at a level beyond that of humans (e.g., recognizing faces, or playing \"Go\" [ 144 ] ). Deep neural networks [ edit source ] A deep neural network (DNN) is an artificial neural network with multiple layers between the input and output layers. [ 7 ] [ 9 ] There are different types of neural networks but they always consist of the same components: neurons, synapses, weights, biases, and functions. [ 145 ] These components as a whole function in a way that mimics functions of the human brain, and can be trained like any other ML algorithm. [ citation needed ] For example, a DNN that is trained to recognize dog breeds will go over the given image and calculate the probability that the dog in the image is a certain breed. The user can review the results and select which probabilities the network should display (above a certain threshold, etc.) and return the proposed label. Each mathematical manipulation as such is considered a layer, [ 146 ] and complex DNN have many layers, hence the name \"deep\" networks. DNNs can model complex non-linear relationships. DNN architectures generate compositional models where the object is expressed as a layered composition of primitives . [ 147 ] The extra layers enable composition of features from lower layers, potentially modeling complex data with fewer units than a similarly performing shallow network. [ 7 ] For instance, it was proved that sparse multivariate polynomials are exponentially easier to approximate with DNNs than with shallow networks. [ 148 ] Deep architectures include many variants of a few basic approaches. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

The weights and inputs are multiplied and return an output between 0 and 1. If the network did not accurately recognize a particular pattern, an algorithm would adjust the weights. [ 149 ] That way the algorithm can make certain parameters more influential, until it determines the correct mathematical manipulation to fully process the data. Recurrent neural networks , in which data can flow in any direction, are used for applications such as language modeling . [ 150 ] [ 151 ] [ 152 ] [ 153 ] [ 154 ] Long short-term memory is particularly effective for this use. [ 155 ] [ 156 ] Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used in computer vision. [ 157 ] CNNs also have been applied to acoustic modeling for automatic speech recognition (ASR). [ 158 ] Challenges [ edit source ] As with ANNs, many issues can arise with naively trained DNNs. Two common issues are overfitting and computation time. DNNs are prone to overfitting because of the added layers of abstraction, which allow them to model rare dependencies in the training data. Regularization methods such as Ivakhnenko's unit pruning [ 41 ] or weight decay ( ℓ 2 {\\displaystyle \\ell _{2}} -regularization) or sparsity ( ℓ 1 {\\displaystyle \\ell _{1}} -regularization) can be applied during training to combat overfitting. [ 159 ] Alternatively dropout regularization randomly omits units from the hidden layers during training. This helps to exclude rare dependencies. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

This approach has been successfully applied for multivariate time series prediction tasks such as traffic prediction. [ 161 ] Finally, data can be augmented via methods such as cropping and rotating such that smaller training sets can be increased in size to reduce the chances of overfitting. [ 162 ] DNNs must consider many training parameters, such as the size (number of layers and number of units per layer), the learning rate , and initial weights. Sweeping through the parameter space for optimal parameters may not be feasible due to the cost in time and computational resources. Various tricks, such as batching (computing the gradient on several training examples at once rather than individual examples) [ 163 ] speed up computation. Large processing capabilities of many-core architectures (such as GPUs or the Intel Xeon Phi) have produced significant speedups in training, because of the suitability of such processing architectures for the matrix and vector computations. [ 164 ] [ 165 ] Alternatively, engineers may look for other types of neural networks with more straightforward and convergent training algorithms. CMAC ( cerebellar model articulation controller ) is one such kind of neural network. It doesn't require learning rates or randomized initial weights. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 168 ] By 2019, graphics processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method for training large-scale commercial cloud AI . [ 169 ] OpenAI estimated the hardware computation used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017) and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of computation required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months. [ 170 ] [ 171 ] Special electronic circuits called deep learning processors were designed to speed up deep learning algorithms. Deep learning processors include neural processing units (NPUs) in Huawei cellphones [ 172 ] and cloud computing servers such as tensor processing units (TPU) in the Google Cloud Platform . [ 173 ] Cerebras Systems has also built a dedicated system to handle large deep learning models, the CS-2, based on the largest processor in the industry, the second-generation Wafer Scale Engine (WSE-2). [ 174 ] [ 175 ] Atomically thin semiconductors are considered promising for energy-efficient deep learning hardware where the same basic device structure is used for both logic operations and data storage. In 2020, Marega et al. published experiments with a large-area active channel material for developing logic-in-memory devices and circuits based on floating-gate field-effect transistors (FGFETs). [ 176 ] In 2021, J. Feldmann et al. proposed an integrated photonic hardware accelerator for parallel convolutional processing. [ 177 ] The authors identify two key advantages of integrated photonics over its electronic counterparts: (1) massively parallel data transfer through wavelength division multiplexing in conjunction with frequency combs , and (2) extremely high data modulation speeds. [ 177 ] Their system can execute trillions of multiply-accumulate operations per second, indicating the potential of integrated photonics in data-heavy AI applications. [ 177 ] Applications [ edit source ] Automatic speech recognition [ edit source ] Main article: Speech recognition Large-scale automatic speech recognition is the first and most convincing successful case of deep learning. LSTM RNNs can learn \"Very Deep Learning\" tasks [ 9 ] that involve multi-second intervals containing speech events separated by thousands of discrete time steps, where one time step corresponds to about 10 ms. LSTM with forget gates [ 156 ] is competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks. [ 93 ] The initial success in speech recognition was based on small-scale recognition tasks based on TIMIT. The data set contains 630 speakers from eight major dialects of American English , where each speaker reads 10 sentences. [ 178 ] Its small size lets many configurations be tried. More importantly, the TIMIT task concerns phone -sequence recognition, which, unlike word-sequence recognition, allows weak phone bigram language models. This lets the strength of the acoustic modeling aspects of speech recognition be more easily analyzed. The error rates listed below, including these early results and measured as percent phone error rates (PER), have been summarized since 1991.

The estimated value function was shown to have a natural interpretation as customer lifetime value . [ 223 ] Recommendation systems [ edit source ] Main article: Recommender system Recommendation systems have used deep learning to extract meaningful features for a latent factor model for content-based music and journal recommendations. [ 224 ] [ 225 ] Multi-view deep learning has been applied for learning user preferences from multiple domains. [ 226 ] The model uses a hybrid collaborative and content-based approach and enhances recommendations in multiple tasks. Bioinformatics [ edit source ] Main article: Bioinformatics An autoencoder ANN was used in bioinformatics , to predict gene ontology annotations and gene-function relationships. [ 227 ] In medical informatics, deep learning was used to predict sleep quality based on data from wearables [ 228 ] and predictions of health complications from electronic health record data. [ 229 ] Deep neural networks have shown unparalleled performance in predicting protein structure , according to the sequence of the amino acids that make it up. In 2020, AlphaFold , a deep-learning based system, achieved a level of accuracy significantly higher than all previous computational methods. [ 230 ] [ 231 ] Deep Neural Network Estimations [ edit source ] Deep neural networks can be used to estimate the entropy of a stochastic process and called Neural Joint Entropy Estimator (NJEE). [ 232 ] Such an estimation provides insights on the effects of input random variables on an independent random variable . Practically, the DNN is trained as a classifier that maps an input vector or matrix X to an output probability distribution over the possible classes of random variable Y, given input X. For example, in image classification tasks, the NJEE maps a vector of pixels ' color values to probabilities over possible image classes. In practice, the probability distribution of Y is obtained by a Softmax layer with number of nodes that is equal to the alphabet size of Y. NJEE uses continuously differentiable activation functions , such that the conditions for the universal approximation theorem holds. It is shown that this method provides a strongly consistent estimator and outperforms other methods in case of large alphabet sizes. [ 232 ] Medical image analysis [ edit source ] Deep learning has been shown to produce competitive results in medical application such as cancer cell classification, lesion detection, organ segmentation and image enhancement. [ 233 ] [ 234 ] Modern deep learning tools demonstrate the high accuracy of detecting various diseases and the helpfulness of their use by specialists to improve the diagnosis efficiency. [ 235 ] [ 236 ] Mobile advertising [ edit source ] Finding the appropriate mobile audience for mobile advertising is always challenging, since many data points must be considered and analyzed before a target segment can be created and used in ad serving by any ad server. [ 237 ] Deep learning has been used to interpret large, many-dimensioned advertising datasets. Many data points are collected during the request/serve/click internet advertising cycle. This information can form the basis of machine learning to improve ad selection. Image restoration [ edit source ] Deep learning has been successfully applied to inverse problems such as denoising , super-resolution , inpainting , and film colorization . [ 238 ] These applications include learning methods such as \"Shrinkage Fields for Effective Image Restoration\" [ 239 ] which trains on an image dataset, and Deep Image Prior , which trains on the image that needs restoration. Financial fraud detection [ edit source ] Deep learning is being successfully applied to financial fraud detection , tax evasion detection, [ 240 ] and anti-money laundering. [ 241 ] Materials science [ edit source ] In November 2023, researchers at Google DeepMind and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory announced that they had developed an AI system known as GNoME. This system has contributed to materials science by discovering over 2 million new materials within a relatively short timeframe. GNoME employs deep learning techniques to efficiently explore potential material structures, achieving a significant increase in the identification of stable inorganic crystal structures . The system's predictions were validated through autonomous robotic experiments, demonstrating a noteworthy success rate of 71%. The data of newly discovered materials is publicly available through the Materials Project database, offering researchers the opportunity to identify materials with desired properties for various applications. This development has implications for the future of scientific discovery and the integration of AI in material science research, potentially expediting material innovation and reducing costs in product development. The use of AI and deep learning suggests the possibility of minimizing or eliminating manual lab experiments and allowing scientists to focus more on the design and analysis of unique compounds. [ 242 ] [ 243 ] [ 244 ] Military [ edit source ] The United States Department of Defense applied deep learning to train robots in new tasks through observation. [ 245 ] Partial differential equations [ edit source ] Physics informed neural networks have been used to solve partial differential equations in both forward and inverse problems in a data driven manner. [ 246 ] One example is the reconstructing fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equations . Using physics informed neural networks does not require the often expensive mesh generation that conventional CFD methods rely on. [ 247 ] [ 248 ] Deep backward stochastic differential equation method [ edit source ] Deep backward stochastic differential equation method is a numerical method that combines deep learning with Backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE). This method is particularly useful for solving high-dimensional problems in financial mathematics. By leveraging the powerful function approximation capabilities of deep neural networks , deep BSDE addresses the computational challenges faced by traditional numerical methods in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, traditional methods like finite difference methods or Monte Carlo simulations often struggle with the curse of dimensionality, where computational cost increases exponentially with the number of dimensions. Deep BSDE methods, however, employ deep neural networks to approximate solutions of high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), effectively reducing the computational burden. [ 249 ] In addition, the integration of Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) into the deep BSDE framework enhances its capability by embedding the underlying physical laws directly into the neural network architecture. This ensures that the solutions not only fit the data but also adhere to the governing stochastic differential equations. PINNs leverage the power of deep learning while respecting the constraints imposed by the physical models, resulting in more accurate and reliable solutions for financial mathematics problems. Image reconstruction [ edit source ] Image reconstruction is the reconstruction of the underlying images from the image-related measurements. Several works showed the better and superior performance of the deep learning methods compared to analytical methods for various applications, e.g., spectral imaging [ 250 ] and ultrasound imaging. [ 251 ] Weather prediction [ edit source ] Traditional weather prediction systems solve a very complex system of partial differential equations. GraphCast is a deep learning based model, trained on a long history of weather data to predict how weather patterns change over time. It is able to predict weather conditions for up to 10 days globally, at a very detailed level, and in under a minute, with precision similar to state of the art systems. [ 252 ] [ 253 ] Epigenetic clock [ edit source ] Main article: Epigenetic clock An epigenetic clock is a biochemical test that can be used to measure age. Galkin et al. used deep neural networks to train an epigenetic aging clock of unprecedented accuracy using >6,000 blood samples. [ 254 ] The clock uses information from 1000 CpG sites and predicts people with certain conditions older than healthy controls: IBD , frontotemporal dementia , ovarian cancer , obesity . The aging clock was planned to be released for public use in 2021 by an Insilico Medicine spinoff company Deep Longevity. Relation to human cognitive and brain development [ edit source ] Deep learning is closely related to a class of theories of brain development (specifically, neocortical development) proposed by cognitive neuroscientists in the early 1990s. [ 255 ] [ 256 ] [ 257 ] [ 258 ] These developmental theories were instantiated in computational models, making them predecessors of deep learning systems. These developmental models share the property that various proposed learning dynamics in the brain (e.g., a wave of nerve growth factor ) support the self-organization somewhat analogous to the neural networks utilized in deep learning models. Like the neocortex , neural networks employ a hierarchy of layered filters in which each layer considers information from a prior layer (or the operating environment), and then passes its output (and possibly the original input), to other layers. This process yields a self-organizing stack of transducers , well-tuned to their operating environment. A 1995 description stated, \"...the infant's brain seems to organize itself under the influence of waves of so-called trophic-factors ... different regions of the brain become connected sequentially, with one layer of tissue maturing before another and so on until the whole brain is mature\". [ 259 ] A variety of approaches have been used to investigate the plausibility of deep learning models from a neurobiological perspective. On the one hand, several variants of the backpropagation algorithm have been proposed in order to increase its processing realism. [ 260 ] [ 261 ] Other researchers have argued that unsupervised forms of deep learning, such as those based on hierarchical generative models and deep belief networks , may be closer to biological reality. [ 262 ] [ 263 ] In this respect, generative neural network models have been related to neurobiological evidence about sampling-based processing in the cerebral cortex. [ 264 ] Although a systematic comparison between the human brain organization and the neuronal encoding in deep networks has not yet been established, several analogies have been reported. For example, the computations performed by deep learning units could be similar to those of actual neurons [ 265 ] and neural populations. [ 266 ] Similarly, the representations developed by deep learning models are similar to those measured in the primate visual system [ 267 ] both at the single-unit [ 268 ] and at the population [ 269 ] levels.", "strategy": "semantic"}

The field takes inspiration from biological neuroscience and is centered around stacking artificial neurons into layers and \"training\" them to process data. The adjective \"deep\" refers to the use of multiple layers (ranging from three to several hundred or thousands) in the network. Methods used can be supervised , semi-supervised or unsupervised . [ 2 ] Some common deep learning network architectures include fully connected networks , deep belief networks , recurrent neural networks , convolutional neural networks , generative adversarial networks , transformers , and neural radiance fields . These architectures have been applied to fields including computer vision , speech recognition , natural language processing , machine translation , bioinformatics , drug design , medical image analysis , climate science , material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Early forms of neural networks were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems , particularly the human brain . However, current neural networks do not intend to model the brain function of organisms, and are generally seen as low-quality models for that purpose. [ 6 ] Overview [ edit source ] Most modern deep learning models are based on multi-layered neural networks such as convolutional neural networks and transformers , although they can also include propositional formulas or latent variables organized layer-wise in deep generative models such as the nodes in deep belief networks and deep Boltzmann machines . [ 7 ] Fundamentally, deep learning refers to a class of machine learning algorithms in which a hierarchy of layers is used to transform input data into a progressively more abstract and composite representation. For example, in an image recognition model, the raw input may be an image (represented as a tensor of pixels ). The first representational layer may attempt to identify basic shapes such as lines and circles, the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges, the third layer may encode a nose and eyes, and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains a face. Importantly, a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place at which level on its own . Prior to deep learning, machine learning techniques often involved hand-crafted feature engineering to transform the data into a more suitable representation for a classification algorithm to operate on. In the deep learning approach, features are not hand-crafted and the model discovers useful feature representations from the data automatically. This does not eliminate the need for hand-tuning; for example, varying numbers of layers and layer sizes can provide different degrees of abstraction. [ 8 ] [ 2 ] The word \"deep\" in \"deep learning\" refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed. More precisely, deep learning systems have a substantial credit assignment path (CAP) depth. The CAP is the chain of transformations from input to output. CAPs describe potentially causal connections between input and output. For a feedforward neural network , the depth of the CAPs is that of the network and is the number of hidden layers plus one (as the output layer is also parameterized). For recurrent neural networks , in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once, the CAP depth is potentially unlimited. [ 9 ] No universally agreed-upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning, but most researchers agree that deep learning involves CAP depth higher than two. CAP of depth two has been shown to be a universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function. [ 10 ] Beyond that, more layers do not add to the function approximator ability of the network. Deep models (CAP > two) are able to extract better features than shallow models and hence, extra layers help in learning the features effectively. Deep learning architectures can be constructed with a greedy layer-by-layer method. [ 11 ] Deep learning helps to disentangle these abstractions and pick out which features improve performance. [ 8 ] Deep learning algorithms can be applied to unsupervised learning tasks. This is an important benefit because unlabeled data is more abundant than the labeled data. Examples of deep structures that can be trained in an unsupervised manner are deep belief networks . [ 8 ] [ 12 ] The term deep learning was introduced to the machine learning community by Rina Dechter in 1986, [ 13 ] and to artificial neural networks by Igor Aizenberg and colleagues in 2000, in the context of Boolean threshold neurons. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Although the history of its appearance is apparently more complicated. [ 16 ] Interpretations [ edit source ] Deep neural networks are generally interpreted in terms of the universal approximation theorem [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] or probabilistic inference . [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 24 ] The classic universal approximation theorem concerns the capacity of feedforward neural networks with a single hidden layer of finite size to approximate continuous functions . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] In 1989, the first proof was published by George Cybenko for sigmoid activation functions [ 17 ] and was generalised to feed-forward multi-layer architectures in 1991 by Kurt Hornik. [ 18 ] Recent work also showed that universal approximation also holds for non-bounded activation functions such as Kunihiko Fukushima 's rectified linear unit . [ 25 ] [ 26 ] The universal approximation theorem for deep neural networks concerns the capacity of networks with bounded width but the depth is allowed to grow. Lu et al. [ 21 ] proved that if the width of a deep neural network with ReLU activation is strictly larger than the input dimension, then the network can approximate any Lebesgue integrable function ; if the width is smaller or equal to the input dimension, then a deep neural network is not a universal approximator. The probabilistic interpretation [ 24 ] derives from the field of machine learning . ", "strategy": "semantic"}

More specifically, the probabilistic interpretation considers the activation nonlinearity as a cumulative distribution function . [ 24 ] The probabilistic interpretation led to the introduction of dropout as regularizer in neural networks. The probabilistic interpretation was introduced by researchers including Hopfield , Widrow and Narendra and popularized in surveys such as the one by Bishop . [ 27 ] History [ edit source ] Before 1980 [ edit source ] There are two types of artificial neural network (ANN): feedforward neural network (FNN) or multilayer perceptron (MLP) and recurrent neural networks (RNN). RNNs have cycles in their connectivity structure, FNNs don't. In the 1920s, Wilhelm Lenz and Ernst Ising created the Ising model [ 28 ] [ 29 ] which is essentially a non-learning RNN architecture consisting of neuron-like threshold elements. In 1972, Shun'ichi Amari made this architecture adaptive. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 32 ] Other early recurrent neural networks were published by Kaoru Nakano in 1971. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Already in 1948, Alan Turing produced work on \"Intelligent Machinery\" that was not published in his lifetime, [ 35 ] containing \"ideas related to artificial evolution and learning RNNs\". [ 31 ] Frank Rosenblatt (1958) [ 36 ] proposed the perceptron, an MLP with 3 layers: an input layer, a hidden layer with randomized weights that did not learn, and an output layer. He later published a 1962 book that also introduced variants and computer experiments, including a version with four-layer perceptrons \"with adaptive preterminal networks\" where the last two layers have learned weights (here he credits H. D. Block and B. W. Knight). [ 37 ] : section 16 The book cites an earlier network by R. D. Joseph (1960) [ 38 ] \"functionally equivalent to a variation of\" this four-layer system (the book mentions Joseph over 30 times). Should Joseph therefore be considered the originator of proper adaptive multilayer perceptrons with learning hidden units? Unfortunately, the learning algorithm was not a functional one, and fell into oblivion. The first working deep learning algorithm was the Group method of data handling , a method to train arbitrarily deep neural networks, published by Alexey Ivakhnenko and Lapa in 1965. They regarded it as a form of polynomial regression, [ 39 ] or a generalization of Rosenblatt's perceptron to handle more complex, nonlinear, and hierarchical relationships. [ 40 ] A 1971 paper described a deep network with eight layers trained by this method, [ 41 ] which is based on layer by layer training through regression analysis. Superfluous hidden units are pruned using a separate validation set. Since the activation functions of the nodes are Kolmogorov-Gabor polynomials, these were also the first deep networks with multiplicative units or \"gates\". [ 31 ] The first deep learning multilayer perceptron trained by stochastic gradient descent [ 42 ] was published in 1967 by Shun'ichi Amari . [ 43 ] In computer experiments conducted by Amari's student Saito, a five layer MLP with two modifiable layers learned internal representations to classify non-linearily separable pattern classes. [ 31 ] Subsequent developments in hardware and hyperparameter tunings have made end-to-end stochastic gradient descent the currently dominant training technique. In 1969, Kunihiko Fukushima introduced the ReLU (rectified linear unit) activation function . [ 25 ] [ 31 ] The rectifier has become the most popular activation function for deep learning. [ 44 ] Deep learning architectures for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with convolutional layers and downsampling layers began with the Neocognitron introduced by Kunihiko Fukushima in 1979, though not trained by backpropagation. [ 45 ] [ 46 ] Backpropagation is an efficient application of the chain rule derived by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1673 [ 47 ] to networks of differentiable nodes. The terminology \"back-propagating errors\" was actually introduced in 1962 by Rosenblatt, [ 37 ] but he did not know how to implement this, although Henry J. Kelley had a continuous precursor of backpropagation in 1960 in the context of control theory .

[ 55 ] [ 56 ] 1980s-2000s [ edit source ] The time delay neural network (TDNN) was introduced in 1987 by Alex Waibel to apply CNN to phoneme recognition. It used convolutions, weight sharing, and backpropagation. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] In 1988, Wei Zhang applied a backpropagation-trained CNN to alphabet recognition. [ 59 ] In 1989, Yann LeCun et al. created a CNN called LeNet for recognizing handwritten ZIP codes on mail. Training required 3 days. [ 60 ] In 1990, Wei Zhang implemented a CNN on optical computing hardware. [ 61 ] In 1991, a CNN was applied to medical image object segmentation [ 62 ] and breast cancer detection in mammograms. [ 63 ] LeNet -5 (1998), a 7-level CNN by Yann LeCun et al., that classifies digits, was applied by several banks to recognize hand-written numbers on checks digitized in 32x32 pixel images. [ 64 ] Recurrent neural networks (RNN) [ 28 ] [ 30 ] were further developed in the 1980s. Recurrence is used for sequence processing, and when a recurrent network is unrolled, it mathematically resembles a deep feedforward layer. Consequently, they have similar properties and issues, and their developments had mutual influences. In RNN, two early influential works were the Jordan network (1986) [ 65 ] and the Elman network (1990), [ 66 ] which applied RNN to study problems in cognitive psychology . In the 1980s, backpropagation did not work well for deep learning with long credit assignment paths. To overcome this problem, in 1991, Jürgen Schmidhuber proposed a hierarchy of RNNs pre-trained one level at a time by self-supervised learning where each RNN tries to predict its own next input, which is the next unexpected input of the RNN below. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] This \"neural history compressor\" uses predictive coding to learn internal representations at multiple self-organizing time scales. This can substantially facilitate downstream deep learning. The RNN hierarchy can be collapsed into a single RNN, by distilling a higher level chunker network into a lower level automatizer network. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 31 ] In 1993, a neural history compressor solved a \"Very Deep Learning\" task that required more than 1000 subsequent layers in an RNN unfolded in time. [ 69 ] The \"P\" in ChatGPT refers to such pre-training. Sepp Hochreiter 's diploma thesis (1991) [ 70 ] implemented the neural history compressor, [ 67 ] and identified and analyzed the vanishing gradient problem . [ 70 ] [ 71 ] Hochreiter proposed recurrent residual connections to solve the vanishing gradient problem. This led to the long short-term memory (LSTM), published in 1995. [ 72 ] LSTM can learn \"very deep learning\" tasks [ 9 ] with long credit assignment paths that require memories of events that happened thousands of discrete time steps before. That LSTM was not yet the modern architecture, which required a \"forget gate\", introduced in 1999, [ 73 ] which became the standard RNN architecture. In 1991, Jürgen Schmidhuber also published adversarial neural networks that contest with each other in the form of a zero-sum game , where one network's gain is the other network's loss. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] The first network is a generative model that models a probability distribution over output patterns. The second network learns by gradient descent to predict the reactions of the environment to these patterns. This was called \"artificial curiosity\". In 2014, this principle was used in generative adversarial networks (GANs). [ 76 ] During 1985–1995, inspired by statistical mechanics, several architectures and methods were developed by Terry Sejnowski , Peter Dayan , Geoffrey Hinton , etc., including the Boltzmann machine , [ 77 ] restricted Boltzmann machine , [ 78 ] Helmholtz machine , [ 79 ] and the wake-sleep algorithm . [ 80 ] These were designed for unsupervised learning of deep generative models. However, those were more computationally expensive compared to backpropagation. Boltzmann machine learning algorithm, published in 1985, was briefly popular before being eclipsed by the backpropagation algorithm in 1986. (p. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

A 1988 network became state of the art in protein structure prediction , an early application of deep learning to bioinformatics. [ 82 ] Both shallow and deep learning (e.g., recurrent nets) of ANNs for speech recognition have been explored for many years. [ 83 ] [ 84 ] [ 85 ] These methods never outperformed non-uniform internal-handcrafting Gaussian mixture model / Hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) technology based on generative models of speech trained discriminatively. [ 86 ] Key difficulties have been analyzed, including gradient diminishing [ 70 ] and weak temporal correlation structure in neural predictive models. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] Additional difficulties were the lack of training data and limited computing power. Most speech recognition researchers moved away from neural nets to pursue generative modeling. An exception was at SRI International in the late 1990s. Funded by the US government's NSA and DARPA , SRI researched in speech and speaker recognition . The speaker recognition team led by Larry Heck reported significant success with deep neural networks in speech processing in the 1998 NIST Speaker Recognition benchmark. [ 89 ] [ 90 ] It was deployed in the Nuance Verifier, representing the first major industrial application of deep learning. [ 91 ] The principle of elevating \"raw\" features over hand-crafted optimization was first explored successfully in the architecture of deep autoencoder on the \"raw\" spectrogram or linear filter-bank features in the late 1990s, [ 90 ] showing its superiority over the Mel-Cepstral features that contain stages of fixed transformation from spectrograms. The raw features of speech, waveforms , later produced excellent larger-scale results. [ 92 ] 2000s [ edit source ] Neural networks entered a lull, and simpler models that use task-specific handcrafted features such as Gabor filters and support vector machines (SVMs) became the preferred choices in the 1990s and 2000s, because of artificial neural networks' computational cost and a lack of understanding of how the brain wires its biological networks. [ citation needed ] In 2003, LSTM became competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks. [ 93 ] In 2006, Alex Graves , Santiago Fernández, Faustino Gomez, and Schmidhuber combined it with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) [ 94 ] in stacks of LSTMs. [ 95 ] In 2009, it became the first RNN to win a pattern recognition contest, in connected handwriting recognition . [ 96 ] [ 9 ] In 2006, publications by Geoff Hinton , Ruslan Salakhutdinov , Osindero and Teh [ 97 ] [ 98 ] deep belief networks were developed for generative modeling. They are trained by training one restricted Boltzmann machine, then freezing it and training another one on top of the first one, and so on, then optionally fine-tuned using supervised backpropagation. [ 99 ] They could model high-dimensional probability distributions, such as the distribution of MNIST images , but convergence was slow. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] [ 102 ] The impact of deep learning in industry began in the early 2000s, when CNNs already processed an estimated 10% to 20% of all the checks written in the US, according to Yann LeCun. [ 103 ] Industrial applications of deep learning to large-scale speech recognition started around 2010. The 2009 NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning for Speech Recognition was motivated by the limitations of deep generative models of speech, and the possibility that given more capable hardware and large-scale data sets that deep neural nets might become practical. It was believed that pre-training DNNs using generative models of deep belief nets (DBN) would overcome the main difficulties of neural nets. However, it was discovered that replacing pre-training with large amounts of training data for straightforward backpropagation when using DNNs with large, context-dependent output layers produced error rates dramatically lower than then-state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture model (GMM)/Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and also than more-advanced generative model-based systems. [ 104 ] The nature of the recognition errors produced by the two types of systems was characteristically different, [ 105 ] offering technical insights into how to integrate deep learning into the existing highly efficient, run-time speech decoding system deployed by all major speech recognition systems. [ 23 ] [ 106 ] [ 107 ] Analysis around 2009–2010, contrasting the GMM (and other generative speech models) vs. DNN models, stimulated early industrial investment in deep learning for speech recognition. [ 105 ] That analysis was done with comparable performance (less than 1.5% in error rate) between discriminative DNNs and generative models. [ 104 ] [ 105 ] [ 108 ] In 2010, researchers extended deep learning from TIMIT to large vocabulary speech recognition, by adopting large output layers of the DNN based on context-dependent HMM states constructed by decision trees . [ 109 ] [ 110 ] [ 111 ] [ 106 ] Deep learning revolution [ edit source ] How deep learning is a subset of machine learning and how machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) The deep learning revolution started around CNN- and GPU-based computer vision. Although CNNs trained by backpropagation had been around for decades and GPU implementations of NNs for years, [ 112 ] including CNNs, [ 113 ] faster implementations of CNNs on GPUs were needed to progress on computer vision. Later, as deep learning becomes widespread, specialized hardware and algorithm optimizations were developed specifically for deep learning. [ 114 ] A key advance for the deep learning revolution was hardware advances, especially GPU. Some early work dated back to 2004. [ 112 ] [ 113 ] In 2009, Raina, Madhavan, and Andrew Ng reported a 100M deep belief network trained on 30 Nvidia GeForce GTX 280 GPUs, an early demonstration of GPU-based deep learning. They reported up to 70 times faster training. [ 115 ] In 2011, a CNN named DanNet [ 116 ] [ 117 ] by Dan Ciresan, Ueli Meier, Jonathan Masci, Luca Maria Gambardella , and Jürgen Schmidhuber achieved for the first time superhuman performance in a visual pattern recognition contest, outperforming traditional methods by a factor of 3. [ 9 ] It then won more contests. [ 118 ] [ 119 ] They also showed how max-pooling CNNs on GPU improved performance significantly. [ 3 ] In 2012, Andrew Ng and Jeff Dean created an FNN that learned to recognize higher-level concepts, such as cats, only from watching unlabeled images taken from YouTube videos. [ 120 ] In October 2012, AlexNet by Alex Krizhevsky , Ilya Sutskever , and Geoffrey Hinton [ 4 ] won the large-scale ImageNet competition by a significant margin over shallow machine learning methods. Further incremental improvements included the VGG-16 network by Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman [ 121 ] and Google's Inceptionv3 . [ 122 ] The success in image classification was then extended to the more challenging task of generating descriptions (captions) for images, often as a combination of CNNs and LSTMs. [ 123 ] [ 124 ] [ 125 ] In 2014, the state of the art was training “very deep neural network” with 20 to 30 layers.

[ 128 ] In 2015, two techniques were developed to train very deep networks: the Highway Network was published in May 2015, and the residual neural network (ResNet) [ 129 ] in Dec 2015. ResNet behaves like an open-gated Highway Net. Around the same time, deep learning started impacting the field of art. Early examples included Google DeepDream (2015), and neural style transfer (2015), [ 130 ] both of which were based on pretrained image classification neural networks, such as VGG-19 . Generative adversarial network (GAN) by ( Ian Goodfellow et al., 2014) [ 131 ] (based on Jürgen Schmidhuber 's principle of artificial curiosity [ 74 ] [ 76 ] ) became state of the art in generative modeling during 2014-2018 period. Excellent image quality is achieved by Nvidia 's StyleGAN (2018) [ 132 ] based on the Progressive GAN by Tero Karras et al. [ 133 ] Here the GAN generator is grown from small to large scale in a pyramidal fashion. Image generation by GAN reached popular success, and provoked discussions concerning deepfakes . [ 134 ] Diffusion models (2015) [ 135 ] eclipsed GANs in generative modeling since then, with systems such as DALL·E 2 (2022) and Stable Diffusion (2022). In 2015, Google's speech recognition improved by 49% by an LSTM-based model, which they made available through Google Voice Search on smartphone . [ 136 ] [ 137 ] Deep learning is part of state-of-the-art systems in various disciplines, particularly computer vision and automatic speech recognition (ASR). Results on commonly used evaluation sets such as TIMIT (ASR) and MNIST ( image classification ), as well as a range of large-vocabulary speech recognition tasks have steadily improved. [ 104 ] [ 138 ] Convolutional neural networks were superseded for ASR by LSTM . [ 137 ] [ 139 ] [ 140 ] [ 141 ] but are more successful in computer vision. Yoshua Bengio , Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun were awarded the 2018 Turing Award for \"conceptual and engineering breakthroughs that have made deep neural networks a critical component of computing\". [ 142 ] Neural networks [ edit source ] Main article: Artificial neural network Simplified example of training a neural network in object detection: The network is trained by multiple images that are known to depict starfish and sea urchins , which are correlated with \"nodes\" that represent visual features . The starfish match with a ringed texture and a star outline, whereas most sea urchins match with a striped texture and oval shape. However, the instance of a ring textured sea urchin creates a weakly weighted association between them. Subsequent run of the network on an input image (left): [ 143 ] The network correctly detects the starfish. However, the weakly weighted association between ringed texture and sea urchin also confers a weak signal to the latter from one of two intermediate nodes. In addition, a shell that was not included in the training gives a weak signal for the oval shape, also resulting in a weak signal for the sea urchin output. These weak signals may result in a false positive result for sea urchin. In reality, textures and outlines would not be represented by single nodes, but rather by associated weight patterns of multiple nodes. Artificial neural networks ( ANNs ) or connectionist systems are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems learn (progressively improve their ability) to do tasks by considering examples, generally without task-specific programming. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

They have found most use in applications difficult to express with a traditional computer algorithm using rule-based programming . An ANN is based on a collection of connected units called artificial neurons , (analogous to biological neurons in a biological brain ). Each connection ( synapse ) between neurons can transmit a signal to another neuron. The receiving (postsynaptic) neuron can process the signal(s) and then signal downstream neurons connected to it. Neurons may have state, generally represented by real numbers , typically between 0 and 1. Neurons and synapses may also have a weight that varies as learning proceeds, which can increase or decrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream. Typically, neurons are organized in layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first (input), to the last (output) layer, possibly after traversing the layers multiple times. The original goal of the neural network approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. Over time, attention focused on matching specific mental abilities, leading to deviations from biology such as backpropagation , or passing information in the reverse direction and adjusting the network to reflect that information. Neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition , machine translation , social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis. As of 2017, neural networks typically have a few thousand to a few million units and millions of connections. Despite this number being several order of magnitude less than the number of neurons on a human brain, these networks can perform many tasks at a level beyond that of humans (e.g., recognizing faces, or playing \"Go\" [ 144 ] ). Deep neural networks [ edit source ] A deep neural network (DNN) is an artificial neural network with multiple layers between the input and output layers. [ 7 ] [ 9 ] There are different types of neural networks but they always consist of the same components: neurons, synapses, weights, biases, and functions. [ 145 ] These components as a whole function in a way that mimics functions of the human brain, and can be trained like any other ML algorithm. [ citation needed ] For example, a DNN that is trained to recognize dog breeds will go over the given image and calculate the probability that the dog in the image is a certain breed. The user can review the results and select which probabilities the network should display (above a certain threshold, etc.) and return the proposed label. Each mathematical manipulation as such is considered a layer, [ 146 ] and complex DNN have many layers, hence the name \"deep\" networks. DNNs can model complex non-linear relationships. DNN architectures generate compositional models where the object is expressed as a layered composition of primitives . [ 147 ] The extra layers enable composition of features from lower layers, potentially modeling complex data with fewer units than a similarly performing shallow network. [ 7 ] For instance, it was proved that sparse multivariate polynomials are exponentially easier to approximate with DNNs than with shallow networks.

[ 149 ] That way the algorithm can make certain parameters more influential, until it determines the correct mathematical manipulation to fully process the data. Recurrent neural networks , in which data can flow in any direction, are used for applications such as language modeling .

Two common issues are overfitting and computation time. DNNs are prone to overfitting because of the added layers of abstraction, which allow them to model rare dependencies in the training data. Regularization methods such as Ivakhnenko's unit pruning [ 41 ] or weight decay ( ℓ 2 {\\displaystyle \\ell _{2}} -regularization) or sparsity ( ℓ 1 {\\displaystyle \\ell _{1}} -regularization) can be applied during training to combat overfitting. [ 159 ] Alternatively dropout regularization randomly omits units from the hidden layers during training. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

This approach has been successfully applied for multivariate time series prediction tasks such as traffic prediction. [ 161 ] Finally, data can be augmented via methods such as cropping and rotating such that smaller training sets can be increased in size to reduce the chances of overfitting. [ 162 ] DNNs must consider many training parameters, such as the size (number of layers and number of units per layer), the learning rate , and initial weights. Sweeping through the parameter space for optimal parameters may not be feasible due to the cost in time and computational resources. Various tricks, such as batching (computing the gradient on several training examples at once rather than individual examples) [ 163 ] speed up computation. Large processing capabilities of many-core architectures (such as GPUs or the Intel Xeon Phi) have produced significant speedups in training, because of the suitability of such processing architectures for the matrix and vector computations. [ 164 ] [ 165 ] Alternatively, engineers may look for other types of neural networks with more straightforward and convergent training algorithms. CMAC ( cerebellar model articulation controller ) is one such kind of neural network. It doesn't require learning rates or randomized initial weights. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 166 ] [ 167 ] Hardware [ edit source ] Since the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units and a very large output layer. [ 168 ] By 2019, graphics processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method for training large-scale commercial cloud AI . [ 169 ] OpenAI estimated the hardware computation used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017) and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of computation required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months. [ 170 ] [ 171 ] Special electronic circuits called deep learning processors were designed to speed up deep learning algorithms. Deep learning processors include neural processing units (NPUs) in Huawei cellphones [ 172 ] and cloud computing servers such as tensor processing units (TPU) in the Google Cloud Platform . [ 173 ] Cerebras Systems has also built a dedicated system to handle large deep learning models, the CS-2, based on the largest processor in the industry, the second-generation Wafer Scale Engine (WSE-2). [ 174 ] [ 175 ] Atomically thin semiconductors are considered promising for energy-efficient deep learning hardware where the same basic device structure is used for both logic operations and data storage. In 2020, Marega et al. published experiments with a large-area active channel material for developing logic-in-memory devices and circuits based on floating-gate field-effect transistors (FGFETs). [ 176 ] In 2021, J. Feldmann et al. proposed an integrated photonic hardware accelerator for parallel convolutional processing. [ 177 ] The authors identify two key advantages of integrated photonics over its electronic counterparts: (1) massively parallel data transfer through wavelength division multiplexing in conjunction with frequency combs , and (2) extremely high data modulation speeds. [ 177 ] Their system can execute trillions of multiply-accumulate operations per second, indicating the potential of integrated photonics in data-heavy AI applications. [ 177 ] Applications [ edit source ] Automatic speech recognition [ edit source ] Main article: Speech recognition Large-scale automatic speech recognition is the first and most convincing successful case of deep learning. LSTM RNNs can learn \"Very Deep Learning\" tasks [ 9 ] that involve multi-second intervals containing speech events separated by thousands of discrete time steps, where one time step corresponds to about 10 ms. LSTM with forget gates [ 156 ] is competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks. [ 93 ] The initial success in speech recognition was based on small-scale recognition tasks based on TIMIT. The data set contains 630 speakers from eight major dialects of American English , where each speaker reads 10 sentences. [ 178 ] Its small size lets many configurations be tried. More importantly, the TIMIT task concerns phone -sequence recognition, which, unlike word-sequence recognition, allows weak phone bigram language models. This lets the strength of the acoustic modeling aspects of speech recognition be more easily analyzed. The error rates listed below, including these early results and measured as percent phone error rates (PER), have been summarized since 1991.

[ 232 ] Such an estimation provides insights on the effects of input random variables on an independent random variable . Practically, the DNN is trained as a classifier that maps an input vector or matrix X to an output probability distribution over the possible classes of random variable Y, given input X. For example, in image classification tasks, the NJEE maps a vector of pixels ' color values to probabilities over possible image classes. In practice, the probability distribution of Y is obtained by a Softmax layer with number of nodes that is equal to the alphabet size of Y. NJEE uses continuously differentiable activation functions , such that the conditions for the universal approximation theorem holds. It is shown that this method provides a strongly consistent estimator and outperforms other methods in case of large alphabet sizes.

This development has implications for the future of scientific discovery and the integration of AI in material science research, potentially expediting material innovation and reducing costs in product development.

Using physics informed neural networks does not require the often expensive mesh generation that conventional CFD methods rely on. [ 247 ] [ 248 ] Deep backward stochastic differential equation method [ edit source ] Deep backward stochastic differential equation method is a numerical method that combines deep learning with Backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE). This method is particularly useful for solving high-dimensional problems in financial mathematics. By leveraging the powerful function approximation capabilities of deep neural networks , deep BSDE addresses the computational challenges faced by traditional numerical methods in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, traditional methods like finite difference methods or Monte Carlo simulations often struggle with the curse of dimensionality, where computational cost increases exponentially with the number of dimensions. Deep BSDE methods, however, employ deep neural networks to approximate solutions of high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), effectively reducing the computational burden. [ 249 ] In addition, the integration of Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) into the deep BSDE framework enhances its capability by embedding the underlying physical laws directly into the neural network architecture. This ensures that the solutions not only fit the data but also adhere to the governing stochastic differential equations. PINNs leverage the power of deep learning while respecting the constraints imposed by the physical models, resulting in more accurate and reliable solutions for financial mathematics problems.

The aging clock was planned to be released for public use in 2021 by an Insilico Medicine spinoff company Deep Longevity. Relation to human cognitive and brain development [ edit source ] Deep learning is closely related to a class of theories of brain development (specifically, neocortical development) proposed by cognitive neuroscientists in the early 1990s. [ 255 ] [ 256 ] [ 257 ] [ 258 ] These developmental theories were instantiated in computational models, making them predecessors of deep learning systems. These developmental models share the property that various proposed learning dynamics in the brain (e.g., a wave of nerve growth factor ) support the self-organization somewhat analogous to the neural networks utilized in deep learning models. Like the neocortex , neural networks employ a hierarchy of layered filters in which each layer considers information from a prior layer (or the operating environment), and then passes its output (and possibly the original input), to other layers. This process yields a self-organizing stack of transducers , well-tuned to their operating environment. A 1995 description stated, \"...the infant's brain seems to organize itself under the influence of waves of so-called trophic-factors ... different regions of the brain become connected sequentially, with one layer of tissue maturing before another and so on until the whole brain is mature\". [ 259 ] A variety of approaches have been used to investigate the plausibility of deep learning models from a neurobiological perspective. On the one hand, several variants of the backpropagation algorithm have been proposed in order to increase its processing realism. [ 260 ] [ 261 ] Other researchers have argued that unsupervised forms of deep learning, such as those based on hierarchical generative models and deep belief networks , may be closer to biological reality. [ 262 ] [ 263 ] In this respect, generative neural network models have been related to neurobiological evidence about sampling-based processing in the cerebral cortex. [ 264 ] Although a systematic comparison between the human brain organization and the neuronal encoding in deep networks has not yet been established, several analogies have been reported. For example, the computations performed by deep learning units could be similar to those of actual neurons [ 265 ] and neural populations. [ 266 ] Similarly, the representations developed by deep learning models are similar to those measured in the primate visual system [ 267 ] both at the single-unit [ 268 ] and at the population [ 269 ] levels.", "strategy": "semantic"}

The field takes inspiration from biological neuroscience and is centered around stacking artificial neurons into layers and \"training\" them to process data. The adjective \"deep\" refers to the use of multiple layers (ranging from three to several hundred or thousands) in the network. Methods used can be supervised , semi-supervised or unsupervised . [ 2 ] Some common deep learning network architectures include fully connected networks , deep belief networks , recurrent neural networks , convolutional neural networks , generative adversarial networks , transformers , and neural radiance fields . These architectures have been applied to fields including computer vision , speech recognition , natural language processing , machine translation , bioinformatics , drug design , medical image analysis , climate science , material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Early forms of neural networks were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems , particularly the human brain . However, current neural networks do not intend to model the brain function of organisms, and are generally seen as low-quality models for that purpose. [ 6 ] Overview [ edit source ] Most modern deep learning models are based on multi-layered neural networks such as convolutional neural networks and transformers , although they can also include propositional formulas or latent variables organized layer-wise in deep generative models such as the nodes in deep belief networks and deep Boltzmann machines . [ 7 ] Fundamentally, deep learning refers to a class of machine learning algorithms in which a hierarchy of layers is used to transform input data into a progressively more abstract and composite representation. For example, in an image recognition model, the raw input may be an image (represented as a tensor of pixels ). The first representational layer may attempt to identify basic shapes such as lines and circles, the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges, the third layer may encode a nose and eyes, and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains a face. Importantly, a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place at which level on its own . Prior to deep learning, machine learning techniques often involved hand-crafted feature engineering to transform the data into a more suitable representation for a classification algorithm to operate on. In the deep learning approach, features are not hand-crafted and the model discovers useful feature representations from the data automatically. This does not eliminate the need for hand-tuning; for example, varying numbers of layers and layer sizes can provide different degrees of abstraction. [ 8 ] [ 2 ] The word \"deep\" in \"deep learning\" refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed. More precisely, deep learning systems have a substantial credit assignment path (CAP) depth. The CAP is the chain of transformations from input to output. CAPs describe potentially causal connections between input and output. For a feedforward neural network , the depth of the CAPs is that of the network and is the number of hidden layers plus one (as the output layer is also parameterized). For recurrent neural networks , in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once, the CAP depth is potentially unlimited. [ 9 ] No universally agreed-upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning, but most researchers agree that deep learning involves CAP depth higher than two. CAP of depth two has been shown to be a universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function. [ 10 ] Beyond that, more layers do not add to the function approximator ability of the network. Deep models (CAP > two) are able to extract better features than shallow models and hence, extra layers help in learning the features effectively. Deep learning architectures can be constructed with a greedy layer-by-layer method. [ 11 ] Deep learning helps to disentangle these abstractions and pick out which features improve performance. [ 8 ] Deep learning algorithms can be applied to unsupervised learning tasks. This is an important benefit because unlabeled data is more abundant than the labeled data. Examples of deep structures that can be trained in an unsupervised manner are deep belief networks . [ 8 ] [ 12 ] The term deep learning was introduced to the machine learning community by Rina Dechter in 1986, [ 13 ] and to artificial neural networks by Igor Aizenberg and colleagues in 2000, in the context of Boolean threshold neurons. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Although the history of its appearance is apparently more complicated. [ 16 ] Interpretations [ edit source ] Deep neural networks are generally interpreted in terms of the universal approximation theorem [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] or probabilistic inference . [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 24 ] The classic universal approximation theorem concerns the capacity of feedforward neural networks with a single hidden layer of finite size to approximate continuous functions . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] In 1989, the first proof was published by George Cybenko for sigmoid activation functions [ 17 ] and was generalised to feed-forward multi-layer architectures in 1991 by Kurt Hornik. [ 18 ] Recent work also showed that universal approximation also holds for non-bounded activation functions such as Kunihiko Fukushima 's rectified linear unit . [ 25 ] [ 26 ] The universal approximation theorem for deep neural networks concerns the capacity of networks with bounded width but the depth is allowed to grow. Lu et al. [ 21 ] proved that if the width of a deep neural network with ReLU activation is strictly larger than the input dimension, then the network can approximate any Lebesgue integrable function ; if the width is smaller or equal to the input dimension, then a deep neural network is not a universal approximator.

[ 24 ] The probabilistic interpretation led to the introduction of dropout as regularizer in neural networks. The probabilistic interpretation was introduced by researchers including Hopfield , Widrow and Narendra and popularized in surveys such as the one by Bishop . [ 27 ] History [ edit source ] Before 1980 [ edit source ] There are two types of artificial neural network (ANN): feedforward neural network (FNN) or multilayer perceptron (MLP) and recurrent neural networks (RNN). RNNs have cycles in their connectivity structure, FNNs don't. In the 1920s, Wilhelm Lenz and Ernst Ising created the Ising model [ 28 ] [ 29 ] which is essentially a non-learning RNN architecture consisting of neuron-like threshold elements. In 1972, Shun'ichi Amari made this architecture adaptive. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 32 ] Other early recurrent neural networks were published by Kaoru Nakano in 1971. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Already in 1948, Alan Turing produced work on \"Intelligent Machinery\" that was not published in his lifetime, [ 35 ] containing \"ideas related to artificial evolution and learning RNNs\". [ 31 ] Frank Rosenblatt (1958) [ 36 ] proposed the perceptron, an MLP with 3 layers: an input layer, a hidden layer with randomized weights that did not learn, and an output layer. He later published a 1962 book that also introduced variants and computer experiments, including a version with four-layer perceptrons \"with adaptive preterminal networks\" where the last two layers have learned weights (here he credits H. D. Block and B. W. Knight). [ 37 ] : section 16 The book cites an earlier network by R. D. Joseph (1960) [ 38 ] \"functionally equivalent to a variation of\" this four-layer system (the book mentions Joseph over 30 times). Should Joseph therefore be considered the originator of proper adaptive multilayer perceptrons with learning hidden units? Unfortunately, the learning algorithm was not a functional one, and fell into oblivion. The first working deep learning algorithm was the Group method of data handling , a method to train arbitrarily deep neural networks, published by Alexey Ivakhnenko and Lapa in 1965. They regarded it as a form of polynomial regression, [ 39 ] or a generalization of Rosenblatt's perceptron to handle more complex, nonlinear, and hierarchical relationships. [ 40 ] A 1971 paper described a deep network with eight layers trained by this method, [ 41 ] which is based on layer by layer training through regression analysis. Superfluous hidden units are pruned using a separate validation set. Since the activation functions of the nodes are Kolmogorov-Gabor polynomials, these were also the first deep networks with multiplicative units or \"gates\". [ 31 ] The first deep learning multilayer perceptron trained by stochastic gradient descent [ 42 ] was published in 1967 by Shun'ichi Amari . [ 43 ] In computer experiments conducted by Amari's student Saito, a five layer MLP with two modifiable layers learned internal representations to classify non-linearily separable pattern classes. [ 31 ] Subsequent developments in hardware and hyperparameter tunings have made end-to-end stochastic gradient descent the currently dominant training technique. In 1969, Kunihiko Fukushima introduced the ReLU (rectified linear unit) activation function . [ 25 ] [ 31 ] The rectifier has become the most popular activation function for deep learning. [ 44 ] Deep learning architectures for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with convolutional layers and downsampling layers began with the Neocognitron introduced by Kunihiko Fukushima in 1979, though not trained by backpropagation. [ 45 ] [ 46 ] Backpropagation is an efficient application of the chain rule derived by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1673 [ 47 ] to networks of differentiable nodes. The terminology \"back-propagating errors\" was actually introduced in 1962 by Rosenblatt, [ 37 ] but he did not know how to implement this, although Henry J. Kelley had a continuous precursor of backpropagation in 1960 in the context of control theory .

[ 55 ] [ 56 ] 1980s-2000s [ edit source ] The time delay neural network (TDNN) was introduced in 1987 by Alex Waibel to apply CNN to phoneme recognition. It used convolutions, weight sharing, and backpropagation. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] In 1988, Wei Zhang applied a backpropagation-trained CNN to alphabet recognition. [ 59 ] In 1989, Yann LeCun et al. created a CNN called LeNet for recognizing handwritten ZIP codes on mail. Training required 3 days. [ 60 ] In 1990, Wei Zhang implemented a CNN on optical computing hardware. [ 61 ] In 1991, a CNN was applied to medical image object segmentation [ 62 ] and breast cancer detection in mammograms. [ 63 ] LeNet -5 (1998), a 7-level CNN by Yann LeCun et al., that classifies digits, was applied by several banks to recognize hand-written numbers on checks digitized in 32x32 pixel images. [ 64 ] Recurrent neural networks (RNN) [ 28 ] [ 30 ] were further developed in the 1980s. Recurrence is used for sequence processing, and when a recurrent network is unrolled, it mathematically resembles a deep feedforward layer. Consequently, they have similar properties and issues, and their developments had mutual influences. In RNN, two early influential works were the Jordan network (1986) [ 65 ] and the Elman network (1990), [ 66 ] which applied RNN to study problems in cognitive psychology . In the 1980s, backpropagation did not work well for deep learning with long credit assignment paths. To overcome this problem, in 1991, Jürgen Schmidhuber proposed a hierarchy of RNNs pre-trained one level at a time by self-supervised learning where each RNN tries to predict its own next input, which is the next unexpected input of the RNN below. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] This \"neural history compressor\" uses predictive coding to learn internal representations at multiple self-organizing time scales. This can substantially facilitate downstream deep learning. The RNN hierarchy can be collapsed into a single RNN, by distilling a higher level chunker network into a lower level automatizer network. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 31 ] In 1993, a neural history compressor solved a \"Very Deep Learning\" task that required more than 1000 subsequent layers in an RNN unfolded in time. [ 69 ] The \"P\" in ChatGPT refers to such pre-training. Sepp Hochreiter 's diploma thesis (1991) [ 70 ] implemented the neural history compressor, [ 67 ] and identified and analyzed the vanishing gradient problem . [ 70 ] [ 71 ] Hochreiter proposed recurrent residual connections to solve the vanishing gradient problem. This led to the long short-term memory (LSTM), published in 1995. [ 72 ] LSTM can learn \"very deep learning\" tasks [ 9 ] with long credit assignment paths that require memories of events that happened thousands of discrete time steps before. That LSTM was not yet the modern architecture, which required a \"forget gate\", introduced in 1999, [ 73 ] which became the standard RNN architecture. In 1991, Jürgen Schmidhuber also published adversarial neural networks that contest with each other in the form of a zero-sum game , where one network's gain is the other network's loss. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] The first network is a generative model that models a probability distribution over output patterns. The second network learns by gradient descent to predict the reactions of the environment to these patterns. This was called \"artificial curiosity\". In 2014, this principle was used in generative adversarial networks (GANs). [ 76 ] During 1985–1995, inspired by statistical mechanics, several architectures and methods were developed by Terry Sejnowski , Peter Dayan , Geoffrey Hinton , etc., including the Boltzmann machine , [ 77 ] restricted Boltzmann machine , [ 78 ] Helmholtz machine , [ 79 ] and the wake-sleep algorithm . [ 80 ] These were designed for unsupervised learning of deep generative models. However, those were more computationally expensive compared to backpropagation. Boltzmann machine learning algorithm, published in 1985, was briefly popular before being eclipsed by the backpropagation algorithm in 1986. (p. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

A 1988 network became state of the art in protein structure prediction , an early application of deep learning to bioinformatics. [ 82 ] Both shallow and deep learning (e.g., recurrent nets) of ANNs for speech recognition have been explored for many years. [ 83 ] [ 84 ] [ 85 ] These methods never outperformed non-uniform internal-handcrafting Gaussian mixture model / Hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) technology based on generative models of speech trained discriminatively. [ 86 ] Key difficulties have been analyzed, including gradient diminishing [ 70 ] and weak temporal correlation structure in neural predictive models. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] Additional difficulties were the lack of training data and limited computing power. Most speech recognition researchers moved away from neural nets to pursue generative modeling. An exception was at SRI International in the late 1990s. Funded by the US government's NSA and DARPA , SRI researched in speech and speaker recognition . The speaker recognition team led by Larry Heck reported significant success with deep neural networks in speech processing in the 1998 NIST Speaker Recognition benchmark. [ 89 ] [ 90 ] It was deployed in the Nuance Verifier, representing the first major industrial application of deep learning. [ 91 ] The principle of elevating \"raw\" features over hand-crafted optimization was first explored successfully in the architecture of deep autoencoder on the \"raw\" spectrogram or linear filter-bank features in the late 1990s, [ 90 ] showing its superiority over the Mel-Cepstral features that contain stages of fixed transformation from spectrograms. The raw features of speech, waveforms , later produced excellent larger-scale results. [ 92 ] 2000s [ edit source ] Neural networks entered a lull, and simpler models that use task-specific handcrafted features such as Gabor filters and support vector machines (SVMs) became the preferred choices in the 1990s and 2000s, because of artificial neural networks' computational cost and a lack of understanding of how the brain wires its biological networks. [ citation needed ] In 2003, LSTM became competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks. [ 93 ] In 2006, Alex Graves , Santiago Fernández, Faustino Gomez, and Schmidhuber combined it with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) [ 94 ] in stacks of LSTMs. [ 95 ] In 2009, it became the first RNN to win a pattern recognition contest, in connected handwriting recognition . [ 96 ] [ 9 ] In 2006, publications by Geoff Hinton , Ruslan Salakhutdinov , Osindero and Teh [ 97 ] [ 98 ] deep belief networks were developed for generative modeling. They are trained by training one restricted Boltzmann machine, then freezing it and training another one on top of the first one, and so on, then optionally fine-tuned using supervised backpropagation. [ 99 ] They could model high-dimensional probability distributions, such as the distribution of MNIST images , but convergence was slow. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] [ 102 ] The impact of deep learning in industry began in the early 2000s, when CNNs already processed an estimated 10% to 20% of all the checks written in the US, according to Yann LeCun. [ 103 ] Industrial applications of deep learning to large-scale speech recognition started around 2010. The 2009 NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning for Speech Recognition was motivated by the limitations of deep generative models of speech, and the possibility that given more capable hardware and large-scale data sets that deep neural nets might become practical. It was believed that pre-training DNNs using generative models of deep belief nets (DBN) would overcome the main difficulties of neural nets. However, it was discovered that replacing pre-training with large amounts of training data for straightforward backpropagation when using DNNs with large, context-dependent output layers produced error rates dramatically lower than then-state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture model (GMM)/Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and also than more-advanced generative model-based systems. [ 104 ] The nature of the recognition errors produced by the two types of systems was characteristically different, [ 105 ] offering technical insights into how to integrate deep learning into the existing highly efficient, run-time speech decoding system deployed by all major speech recognition systems. [ 23 ] [ 106 ] [ 107 ] Analysis around 2009–2010, contrasting the GMM (and other generative speech models) vs. DNN models, stimulated early industrial investment in deep learning for speech recognition. [ 105 ] That analysis was done with comparable performance (less than 1.5% in error rate) between discriminative DNNs and generative models. [ 104 ] [ 105 ] [ 108 ] In 2010, researchers extended deep learning from TIMIT to large vocabulary speech recognition, by adopting large output layers of the DNN based on context-dependent HMM states constructed by decision trees . [ 109 ] [ 110 ] [ 111 ] [ 106 ] Deep learning revolution [ edit source ] How deep learning is a subset of machine learning and how machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) The deep learning revolution started around CNN- and GPU-based computer vision. Although CNNs trained by backpropagation had been around for decades and GPU implementations of NNs for years, [ 112 ] including CNNs, [ 113 ] faster implementations of CNNs on GPUs were needed to progress on computer vision. Later, as deep learning becomes widespread, specialized hardware and algorithm optimizations were developed specifically for deep learning. [ 114 ] A key advance for the deep learning revolution was hardware advances, especially GPU. Some early work dated back to 2004. [ 112 ] [ 113 ] In 2009, Raina, Madhavan, and Andrew Ng reported a 100M deep belief network trained on 30 Nvidia GeForce GTX 280 GPUs, an early demonstration of GPU-based deep learning. They reported up to 70 times faster training. [ 115 ] In 2011, a CNN named DanNet [ 116 ] [ 117 ] by Dan Ciresan, Ueli Meier, Jonathan Masci, Luca Maria Gambardella , and Jürgen Schmidhuber achieved for the first time superhuman performance in a visual pattern recognition contest, outperforming traditional methods by a factor of 3. [ 9 ] It then won more contests. [ 118 ] [ 119 ] They also showed how max-pooling CNNs on GPU improved performance significantly. [ 3 ] In 2012, Andrew Ng and Jeff Dean created an FNN that learned to recognize higher-level concepts, such as cats, only from watching unlabeled images taken from YouTube videos. [ 120 ] In October 2012, AlexNet by Alex Krizhevsky , Ilya Sutskever , and Geoffrey Hinton [ 4 ] won the large-scale ImageNet competition by a significant margin over shallow machine learning methods. Further incremental improvements included the VGG-16 network by Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman [ 121 ] and Google's Inceptionv3 . [ 122 ] The success in image classification was then extended to the more challenging task of generating descriptions (captions) for images, often as a combination of CNNs and LSTMs. [ 123 ] [ 124 ] [ 125 ] In 2014, the state of the art was training “very deep neural network” with 20 to 30 layers.

[ 128 ] In 2015, two techniques were developed to train very deep networks: the Highway Network was published in May 2015, and the residual neural network (ResNet) [ 129 ] in Dec 2015. ResNet behaves like an open-gated Highway Net. Around the same time, deep learning started impacting the field of art. Early examples included Google DeepDream (2015), and neural style transfer (2015), [ 130 ] both of which were based on pretrained image classification neural networks, such as VGG-19 . Generative adversarial network (GAN) by ( Ian Goodfellow et al., 2014) [ 131 ] (based on Jürgen Schmidhuber 's principle of artificial curiosity [ 74 ] [ 76 ] ) became state of the art in generative modeling during 2014-2018 period. Excellent image quality is achieved by Nvidia 's StyleGAN (2018) [ 132 ] based on the Progressive GAN by Tero Karras et al. [ 133 ] Here the GAN generator is grown from small to large scale in a pyramidal fashion. Image generation by GAN reached popular success, and provoked discussions concerning deepfakes . [ 134 ] Diffusion models (2015) [ 135 ] eclipsed GANs in generative modeling since then, with systems such as DALL·E 2 (2022) and Stable Diffusion (2022). In 2015, Google's speech recognition improved by 49% by an LSTM-based model, which they made available through Google Voice Search on smartphone . [ 136 ] [ 137 ] Deep learning is part of state-of-the-art systems in various disciplines, particularly computer vision and automatic speech recognition (ASR). Results on commonly used evaluation sets such as TIMIT (ASR) and MNIST ( image classification ), as well as a range of large-vocabulary speech recognition tasks have steadily improved. [ 104 ] [ 138 ] Convolutional neural networks were superseded for ASR by LSTM . [ 137 ] [ 139 ] [ 140 ] [ 141 ] but are more successful in computer vision. Yoshua Bengio , Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun were awarded the 2018 Turing Award for \"conceptual and engineering breakthroughs that have made deep neural networks a critical component of computing\". [ 142 ] Neural networks [ edit source ] Main article: Artificial neural network Simplified example of training a neural network in object detection: The network is trained by multiple images that are known to depict starfish and sea urchins , which are correlated with \"nodes\" that represent visual features . The starfish match with a ringed texture and a star outline, whereas most sea urchins match with a striped texture and oval shape. However, the instance of a ring textured sea urchin creates a weakly weighted association between them. Subsequent run of the network on an input image (left): [ 143 ] The network correctly detects the starfish. However, the weakly weighted association between ringed texture and sea urchin also confers a weak signal to the latter from one of two intermediate nodes. In addition, a shell that was not included in the training gives a weak signal for the oval shape, also resulting in a weak signal for the sea urchin output. These weak signals may result in a false positive result for sea urchin. In reality, textures and outlines would not be represented by single nodes, but rather by associated weight patterns of multiple nodes. Artificial neural networks ( ANNs ) or connectionist systems are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems learn (progressively improve their ability) to do tasks by considering examples, generally without task-specific programming. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

They have found most use in applications difficult to express with a traditional computer algorithm using rule-based programming . An ANN is based on a collection of connected units called artificial neurons , (analogous to biological neurons in a biological brain ). Each connection ( synapse ) between neurons can transmit a signal to another neuron. The receiving (postsynaptic) neuron can process the signal(s) and then signal downstream neurons connected to it. Neurons may have state, generally represented by real numbers , typically between 0 and 1. Neurons and synapses may also have a weight that varies as learning proceeds, which can increase or decrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream. Typically, neurons are organized in layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first (input), to the last (output) layer, possibly after traversing the layers multiple times. The original goal of the neural network approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. Over time, attention focused on matching specific mental abilities, leading to deviations from biology such as backpropagation , or passing information in the reverse direction and adjusting the network to reflect that information. Neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition , machine translation , social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis. As of 2017, neural networks typically have a few thousand to a few million units and millions of connections. Despite this number being several order of magnitude less than the number of neurons on a human brain, these networks can perform many tasks at a level beyond that of humans (e.g., recognizing faces, or playing \"Go\" [ 144 ] ). Deep neural networks [ edit source ] A deep neural network (DNN) is an artificial neural network with multiple layers between the input and output layers. [ 7 ] [ 9 ] There are different types of neural networks but they always consist of the same components: neurons, synapses, weights, biases, and functions. [ 145 ] These components as a whole function in a way that mimics functions of the human brain, and can be trained like any other ML algorithm. [ citation needed ] For example, a DNN that is trained to recognize dog breeds will go over the given image and calculate the probability that the dog in the image is a certain breed. The user can review the results and select which probabilities the network should display (above a certain threshold, etc.) and return the proposed label. Each mathematical manipulation as such is considered a layer, [ 146 ] and complex DNN have many layers, hence the name \"deep\" networks. DNNs can model complex non-linear relationships. DNN architectures generate compositional models where the object is expressed as a layered composition of primitives . [ 147 ] The extra layers enable composition of features from lower layers, potentially modeling complex data with fewer units than a similarly performing shallow network. [ 7 ] For instance, it was proved that sparse multivariate polynomials are exponentially easier to approximate with DNNs than with shallow networks.

[ 149 ] That way the algorithm can make certain parameters more influential, until it determines the correct mathematical manipulation to fully process the data. Recurrent neural networks , in which data can flow in any direction, are used for applications such as language modeling .

Two common issues are overfitting and computation time. DNNs are prone to overfitting because of the added layers of abstraction, which allow them to model rare dependencies in the training data. Regularization methods such as Ivakhnenko's unit pruning [ 41 ] or weight decay ( ℓ 2 {\\displaystyle \\ell _{2}} -regularization) or sparsity ( ℓ 1 {\\displaystyle \\ell _{1}} -regularization) can be applied during training to combat overfitting.

Sweeping through the parameter space for optimal parameters may not be feasible due to the cost in time and computational resources. Various tricks, such as batching (computing the gradient on several training examples at once rather than individual examples) [ 163 ] speed up computation. Large processing capabilities of many-core architectures (such as GPUs or the Intel Xeon Phi) have produced significant speedups in training, because of the suitability of such processing architectures for the matrix and vector computations.

[ 169 ] OpenAI estimated the hardware computation used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017) and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of computation required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months. [ 170 ] [ 171 ] Special electronic circuits called deep learning processors were designed to speed up deep learning algorithms. Deep learning processors include neural processing units (NPUs) in Huawei cellphones [ 172 ] and cloud computing servers such as tensor processing units (TPU) in the Google Cloud Platform . [ 173 ] Cerebras Systems has also built a dedicated system to handle large deep learning models, the CS-2, based on the largest processor in the industry, the second-generation Wafer Scale Engine (WSE-2). [ 174 ] [ 175 ] Atomically thin semiconductors are considered promising for energy-efficient deep learning hardware where the same basic device structure is used for both logic operations and data storage. In 2020, Marega et al. published experiments with a large-area active channel material for developing logic-in-memory devices and circuits based on floating-gate field-effect transistors (FGFETs). [ 176 ] In 2021, J. Feldmann et al. proposed an integrated photonic hardware accelerator for parallel convolutional processing. [ 177 ] The authors identify two key advantages of integrated photonics over its electronic counterparts: (1) massively parallel data transfer through wavelength division multiplexing in conjunction with frequency combs , and (2) extremely high data modulation speeds. [ 177 ] Their system can execute trillions of multiply-accumulate operations per second, indicating the potential of integrated photonics in data-heavy AI applications. [ 177 ] Applications [ edit source ] Automatic speech recognition [ edit source ] Main article: Speech recognition Large-scale automatic speech recognition is the first and most convincing successful case of deep learning. LSTM RNNs can learn \"Very Deep Learning\" tasks [ 9 ] that involve multi-second intervals containing speech events separated by thousands of discrete time steps, where one time step corresponds to about 10 ms. LSTM with forget gates [ 156 ] is competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks. [ 93 ] The initial success in speech recognition was based on small-scale recognition tasks based on TIMIT. The data set contains 630 speakers from eight major dialects of American English , where each speaker reads 10 sentences. [ 178 ] Its small size lets many configurations be tried. More importantly, the TIMIT task concerns phone -sequence recognition, which, unlike word-sequence recognition, allows weak phone bigram language models. This lets the strength of the acoustic modeling aspects of speech recognition be more easily analyzed. The error rates listed below, including these early results and measured as percent phone error rates (PER), have been summarized since 1991.

Using word embedding as an RNN input layer allows the network to parse sentences and phrases using an effective compositional vector grammar. A compositional vector grammar can be thought of as probabilistic context free grammar (PCFG) implemented by an RNN.

[ 229 ] Deep neural networks have shown unparalleled performance in predicting protein structure , according to the sequence of the amino acids that make it up. In 2020, AlphaFold , a deep-learning based system, achieved a level of accuracy significantly higher than all previous computational methods. [ 230 ] [ 231 ] Deep Neural Network Estimations [ edit source ] Deep neural networks can be used to estimate the entropy of a stochastic process and called Neural Joint Entropy Estimator (NJEE). [ 232 ] Such an estimation provides insights on the effects of input random variables on an independent random variable . Practically, the DNN is trained as a classifier that maps an input vector or matrix X to an output probability distribution over the possible classes of random variable Y, given input X. For example, in image classification tasks, the NJEE maps a vector of pixels ' color values to probabilities over possible image classes. In practice, the probability distribution of Y is obtained by a Softmax layer with number of nodes that is equal to the alphabet size of Y. NJEE uses continuously differentiable activation functions , such that the conditions for the universal approximation theorem holds. It is shown that this method provides a strongly consistent estimator and outperforms other methods in case of large alphabet sizes.

Financial fraud detection [ edit source ] Deep learning is being successfully applied to financial fraud detection , tax evasion detection, [ 240 ] and anti-money laundering. [ 241 ] Materials science [ edit source ] In November 2023, researchers at Google DeepMind and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory announced that they had developed an AI system known as GNoME. This system has contributed to materials science by discovering over 2 million new materials within a relatively short timeframe. GNoME employs deep learning techniques to efficiently explore potential material structures, achieving a significant increase in the identification of stable inorganic crystal structures . The system's predictions were validated through autonomous robotic experiments, demonstrating a noteworthy success rate of 71%. The data of newly discovered materials is publicly available through the Materials Project database, offering researchers the opportunity to identify materials with desired properties for various applications. This development has implications for the future of scientific discovery and the integration of AI in material science research, potentially expediting material innovation and reducing costs in product development. The use of AI and deep learning suggests the possibility of minimizing or eliminating manual lab experiments and allowing scientists to focus more on the design and analysis of unique compounds.

[ 245 ] Partial differential equations [ edit source ] Physics informed neural networks have been used to solve partial differential equations in both forward and inverse problems in a data driven manner. [ 246 ] One example is the reconstructing fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equations . Using physics informed neural networks does not require the often expensive mesh generation that conventional CFD methods rely on. [ 247 ] [ 248 ] Deep backward stochastic differential equation method [ edit source ] Deep backward stochastic differential equation method is a numerical method that combines deep learning with Backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE). This method is particularly useful for solving high-dimensional problems in financial mathematics. By leveraging the powerful function approximation capabilities of deep neural networks , deep BSDE addresses the computational challenges faced by traditional numerical methods in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, traditional methods like finite difference methods or Monte Carlo simulations often struggle with the curse of dimensionality, where computational cost increases exponentially with the number of dimensions. Deep BSDE methods, however, employ deep neural networks to approximate solutions of high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), effectively reducing the computational burden. [ 249 ] In addition, the integration of Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) into the deep BSDE framework enhances its capability by embedding the underlying physical laws directly into the neural network architecture. This ensures that the solutions not only fit the data but also adhere to the governing stochastic differential equations. PINNs leverage the power of deep learning while respecting the constraints imposed by the physical models, resulting in more accurate and reliable solutions for financial mathematics problems. Image reconstruction [ edit source ] Image reconstruction is the reconstruction of the underlying images from the image-related measurements. Several works showed the better and superior performance of the deep learning methods compared to analytical methods for various applications, e.g., spectral imaging [ 250 ] and ultrasound imaging. [ 251 ] Weather prediction [ edit source ] Traditional weather prediction systems solve a very complex system of partial differential equations. GraphCast is a deep learning based model, trained on a long history of weather data to predict how weather patterns change over time. It is able to predict weather conditions for up to 10 days globally, at a very detailed level, and in under a minute, with precision similar to state of the art systems.

Galkin et al. used deep neural networks to train an epigenetic aging clock of unprecedented accuracy using >6,000 blood samples. [ 254 ] The clock uses information from 1000 CpG sites and predicts people with certain conditions older than healthy controls: IBD , frontotemporal dementia , ovarian cancer , obesity . The aging clock was planned to be released for public use in 2021 by an Insilico Medicine spinoff company Deep Longevity. Relation to human cognitive and brain development [ edit source ] Deep learning is closely related to a class of theories of brain development (specifically, neocortical development) proposed by cognitive neuroscientists in the early 1990s. [ 255 ] [ 256 ] [ 257 ] [ 258 ] These developmental theories were instantiated in computational models, making them predecessors of deep learning systems. These developmental models share the property that various proposed learning dynamics in the brain (e.g., a wave of nerve growth factor ) support the self-organization somewhat analogous to the neural networks utilized in deep learning models. Like the neocortex , neural networks employ a hierarchy of layered filters in which each layer considers information from a prior layer (or the operating environment), and then passes its output (and possibly the original input), to other layers. This process yields a self-organizing stack of transducers , well-tuned to their operating environment. A 1995 description stated, \"...the infant's brain seems to organize itself under the influence of waves of so-called trophic-factors ... different regions of the brain become connected sequentially, with one layer of tissue maturing before another and so on until the whole brain is mature\". [ 259 ] A variety of approaches have been used to investigate the plausibility of deep learning models from a neurobiological perspective. On the one hand, several variants of the backpropagation algorithm have been proposed in order to increase its processing realism. [ 260 ] [ 261 ] Other researchers have argued that unsupervised forms of deep learning, such as those based on hierarchical generative models and deep belief networks , may be closer to biological reality. [ 262 ] [ 263 ] In this respect, generative neural network models have been related to neurobiological evidence about sampling-based processing in the cerebral cortex. [ 264 ] Although a systematic comparison between the human brain organization and the neuronal encoding in deep networks has not yet been established, several analogies have been reported. For example, the computations performed by deep learning units could be similar to those of actual neurons [ 265 ] and neural populations. [ 266 ] Similarly, the representations developed by deep learning models are similar to those measured in the primate visual system [ 267 ] both at the single-unit [ 268 ] and at the population [ 269 ] levels.", "strategy": "semantic"}

The field takes inspiration from biological neuroscience and is centered around stacking artificial neurons into layers and \"training\" them to process data. The adjective \"deep\" refers to the use of multiple layers (ranging from three to several hundred or thousands) in the network. Methods used can be supervised , semi-supervised or unsupervised . [ 2 ] Some common deep learning network architectures include fully connected networks , deep belief networks , recurrent neural networks , convolutional neural networks , generative adversarial networks , transformers , and neural radiance fields . These architectures have been applied to fields including computer vision , speech recognition , natural language processing , machine translation , bioinformatics , drug design , medical image analysis , climate science , material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Early forms of neural networks were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems , particularly the human brain . However, current neural networks do not intend to model the brain function of organisms, and are generally seen as low-quality models for that purpose. [ 6 ] Overview [ edit source ] Most modern deep learning models are based on multi-layered neural networks such as convolutional neural networks and transformers , although they can also include propositional formulas or latent variables organized layer-wise in deep generative models such as the nodes in deep belief networks and deep Boltzmann machines . [ 7 ] Fundamentally, deep learning refers to a class of machine learning algorithms in which a hierarchy of layers is used to transform input data into a progressively more abstract and composite representation. For example, in an image recognition model, the raw input may be an image (represented as a tensor of pixels ). The first representational layer may attempt to identify basic shapes such as lines and circles, the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges, the third layer may encode a nose and eyes, and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains a face. Importantly, a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place at which level on its own . Prior to deep learning, machine learning techniques often involved hand-crafted feature engineering to transform the data into a more suitable representation for a classification algorithm to operate on. In the deep learning approach, features are not hand-crafted and the model discovers useful feature representations from the data automatically. This does not eliminate the need for hand-tuning; for example, varying numbers of layers and layer sizes can provide different degrees of abstraction. [ 8 ] [ 2 ] The word \"deep\" in \"deep learning\" refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed. More precisely, deep learning systems have a substantial credit assignment path (CAP) depth. The CAP is the chain of transformations from input to output. CAPs describe potentially causal connections between input and output. For a feedforward neural network , the depth of the CAPs is that of the network and is the number of hidden layers plus one (as the output layer is also parameterized). For recurrent neural networks , in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once, the CAP depth is potentially unlimited. [ 9 ] No universally agreed-upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning, but most researchers agree that deep learning involves CAP depth higher than two. CAP of depth two has been shown to be a universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function. [ 10 ] Beyond that, more layers do not add to the function approximator ability of the network. Deep models (CAP > two) are able to extract better features than shallow models and hence, extra layers help in learning the features effectively. Deep learning architectures can be constructed with a greedy layer-by-layer method. [ 11 ] Deep learning helps to disentangle these abstractions and pick out which features improve performance. [ 8 ] Deep learning algorithms can be applied to unsupervised learning tasks. This is an important benefit because unlabeled data is more abundant than the labeled data. Examples of deep structures that can be trained in an unsupervised manner are deep belief networks . [ 8 ] [ 12 ] The term deep learning was introduced to the machine learning community by Rina Dechter in 1986, [ 13 ] and to artificial neural networks by Igor Aizenberg and colleagues in 2000, in the context of Boolean threshold neurons. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Although the history of its appearance is apparently more complicated. [ 16 ] Interpretations [ edit source ] Deep neural networks are generally interpreted in terms of the universal approximation theorem [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] or probabilistic inference . [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 24 ] The classic universal approximation theorem concerns the capacity of feedforward neural networks with a single hidden layer of finite size to approximate continuous functions . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] In 1989, the first proof was published by George Cybenko for sigmoid activation functions [ 17 ] and was generalised to feed-forward multi-layer architectures in 1991 by Kurt Hornik. [ 18 ] Recent work also showed that universal approximation also holds for non-bounded activation functions such as Kunihiko Fukushima 's rectified linear unit . [ 25 ] [ 26 ] The universal approximation theorem for deep neural networks concerns the capacity of networks with bounded width but the depth is allowed to grow. Lu et al. [ 21 ] proved that if the width of a deep neural network with ReLU activation is strictly larger than the input dimension, then the network can approximate any Lebesgue integrable function ; if the width is smaller or equal to the input dimension, then a deep neural network is not a universal approximator. The probabilistic interpretation [ 24 ] derives from the field of machine learning . ", "strategy": "semantic"}

More specifically, the probabilistic interpretation considers the activation nonlinearity as a cumulative distribution function . [ 24 ] The probabilistic interpretation led to the introduction of dropout as regularizer in neural networks. The probabilistic interpretation was introduced by researchers including Hopfield , Widrow and Narendra and popularized in surveys such as the one by Bishop . [ 27 ] History [ edit source ] Before 1980 [ edit source ] There are two types of artificial neural network (ANN): feedforward neural network (FNN) or multilayer perceptron (MLP) and recurrent neural networks (RNN). RNNs have cycles in their connectivity structure, FNNs don't. In the 1920s, Wilhelm Lenz and Ernst Ising created the Ising model [ 28 ] [ 29 ] which is essentially a non-learning RNN architecture consisting of neuron-like threshold elements. In 1972, Shun'ichi Amari made this architecture adaptive. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 32 ] Other early recurrent neural networks were published by Kaoru Nakano in 1971. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Already in 1948, Alan Turing produced work on \"Intelligent Machinery\" that was not published in his lifetime, [ 35 ] containing \"ideas related to artificial evolution and learning RNNs\". [ 31 ] Frank Rosenblatt (1958) [ 36 ] proposed the perceptron, an MLP with 3 layers: an input layer, a hidden layer with randomized weights that did not learn, and an output layer. He later published a 1962 book that also introduced variants and computer experiments, including a version with four-layer perceptrons \"with adaptive preterminal networks\" where the last two layers have learned weights (here he credits H. D. Block and B. W. Knight). [ 37 ] : section 16 The book cites an earlier network by R. D. Joseph (1960) [ 38 ] \"functionally equivalent to a variation of\" this four-layer system (the book mentions Joseph over 30 times). Should Joseph therefore be considered the originator of proper adaptive multilayer perceptrons with learning hidden units? Unfortunately, the learning algorithm was not a functional one, and fell into oblivion. The first working deep learning algorithm was the Group method of data handling , a method to train arbitrarily deep neural networks, published by Alexey Ivakhnenko and Lapa in 1965. They regarded it as a form of polynomial regression, [ 39 ] or a generalization of Rosenblatt's perceptron to handle more complex, nonlinear, and hierarchical relationships. [ 40 ] A 1971 paper described a deep network with eight layers trained by this method, [ 41 ] which is based on layer by layer training through regression analysis. Superfluous hidden units are pruned using a separate validation set. Since the activation functions of the nodes are Kolmogorov-Gabor polynomials, these were also the first deep networks with multiplicative units or \"gates\". [ 31 ] The first deep learning multilayer perceptron trained by stochastic gradient descent [ 42 ] was published in 1967 by Shun'ichi Amari . [ 43 ] In computer experiments conducted by Amari's student Saito, a five layer MLP with two modifiable layers learned internal representations to classify non-linearily separable pattern classes. [ 31 ] Subsequent developments in hardware and hyperparameter tunings have made end-to-end stochastic gradient descent the currently dominant training technique. In 1969, Kunihiko Fukushima introduced the ReLU (rectified linear unit) activation function . [ 25 ] [ 31 ] The rectifier has become the most popular activation function for deep learning. [ 44 ] Deep learning architectures for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with convolutional layers and downsampling layers began with the Neocognitron introduced by Kunihiko Fukushima in 1979, though not trained by backpropagation. [ 45 ] [ 46 ] Backpropagation is an efficient application of the chain rule derived by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1673 [ 47 ] to networks of differentiable nodes. The terminology \"back-propagating errors\" was actually introduced in 1962 by Rosenblatt, [ 37 ] but he did not know how to implement this, although Henry J. Kelley had a continuous precursor of backpropagation in 1960 in the context of control theory . [ 48 ] The modern form of backpropagation was first published in Seppo Linnainmaa 's master thesis (1970). [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 31 ] G.M. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 55 ] [ 56 ] 1980s-2000s [ edit source ] The time delay neural network (TDNN) was introduced in 1987 by Alex Waibel to apply CNN to phoneme recognition. It used convolutions, weight sharing, and backpropagation. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] In 1988, Wei Zhang applied a backpropagation-trained CNN to alphabet recognition. [ 59 ] In 1989, Yann LeCun et al. created a CNN called LeNet for recognizing handwritten ZIP codes on mail. Training required 3 days. [ 60 ] In 1990, Wei Zhang implemented a CNN on optical computing hardware. [ 61 ] In 1991, a CNN was applied to medical image object segmentation [ 62 ] and breast cancer detection in mammograms. [ 63 ] LeNet -5 (1998), a 7-level CNN by Yann LeCun et al., that classifies digits, was applied by several banks to recognize hand-written numbers on checks digitized in 32x32 pixel images. [ 64 ] Recurrent neural networks (RNN) [ 28 ] [ 30 ] were further developed in the 1980s. Recurrence is used for sequence processing, and when a recurrent network is unrolled, it mathematically resembles a deep feedforward layer. Consequently, they have similar properties and issues, and their developments had mutual influences. In RNN, two early influential works were the Jordan network (1986) [ 65 ] and the Elman network (1990), [ 66 ] which applied RNN to study problems in cognitive psychology . In the 1980s, backpropagation did not work well for deep learning with long credit assignment paths. To overcome this problem, in 1991, Jürgen Schmidhuber proposed a hierarchy of RNNs pre-trained one level at a time by self-supervised learning where each RNN tries to predict its own next input, which is the next unexpected input of the RNN below. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] This \"neural history compressor\" uses predictive coding to learn internal representations at multiple self-organizing time scales. This can substantially facilitate downstream deep learning. The RNN hierarchy can be collapsed into a single RNN, by distilling a higher level chunker network into a lower level automatizer network. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 31 ] In 1993, a neural history compressor solved a \"Very Deep Learning\" task that required more than 1000 subsequent layers in an RNN unfolded in time. [ 69 ] The \"P\" in ChatGPT refers to such pre-training. Sepp Hochreiter 's diploma thesis (1991) [ 70 ] implemented the neural history compressor, [ 67 ] and identified and analyzed the vanishing gradient problem . [ 70 ] [ 71 ] Hochreiter proposed recurrent residual connections to solve the vanishing gradient problem. This led to the long short-term memory (LSTM), published in 1995. [ 72 ] LSTM can learn \"very deep learning\" tasks [ 9 ] with long credit assignment paths that require memories of events that happened thousands of discrete time steps before. That LSTM was not yet the modern architecture, which required a \"forget gate\", introduced in 1999, [ 73 ] which became the standard RNN architecture. In 1991, Jürgen Schmidhuber also published adversarial neural networks that contest with each other in the form of a zero-sum game , where one network's gain is the other network's loss. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] The first network is a generative model that models a probability distribution over output patterns. The second network learns by gradient descent to predict the reactions of the environment to these patterns. This was called \"artificial curiosity\". In 2014, this principle was used in generative adversarial networks (GANs). [ 76 ] During 1985–1995, inspired by statistical mechanics, several architectures and methods were developed by Terry Sejnowski , Peter Dayan , Geoffrey Hinton , etc., including the Boltzmann machine , [ 77 ] restricted Boltzmann machine , [ 78 ] Helmholtz machine , [ 79 ] and the wake-sleep algorithm . [ 80 ] These were designed for unsupervised learning of deep generative models. However, those were more computationally expensive compared to backpropagation. Boltzmann machine learning algorithm, published in 1985, was briefly popular before being eclipsed by the backpropagation algorithm in 1986. (p. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

A 1988 network became state of the art in protein structure prediction , an early application of deep learning to bioinformatics. [ 82 ] Both shallow and deep learning (e.g., recurrent nets) of ANNs for speech recognition have been explored for many years. [ 83 ] [ 84 ] [ 85 ] These methods never outperformed non-uniform internal-handcrafting Gaussian mixture model / Hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) technology based on generative models of speech trained discriminatively. [ 86 ] Key difficulties have been analyzed, including gradient diminishing [ 70 ] and weak temporal correlation structure in neural predictive models. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] Additional difficulties were the lack of training data and limited computing power. Most speech recognition researchers moved away from neural nets to pursue generative modeling. An exception was at SRI International in the late 1990s. Funded by the US government's NSA and DARPA , SRI researched in speech and speaker recognition . The speaker recognition team led by Larry Heck reported significant success with deep neural networks in speech processing in the 1998 NIST Speaker Recognition benchmark. [ 89 ] [ 90 ] It was deployed in the Nuance Verifier, representing the first major industrial application of deep learning. [ 91 ] The principle of elevating \"raw\" features over hand-crafted optimization was first explored successfully in the architecture of deep autoencoder on the \"raw\" spectrogram or linear filter-bank features in the late 1990s, [ 90 ] showing its superiority over the Mel-Cepstral features that contain stages of fixed transformation from spectrograms. The raw features of speech, waveforms , later produced excellent larger-scale results. [ 92 ] 2000s [ edit source ] Neural networks entered a lull, and simpler models that use task-specific handcrafted features such as Gabor filters and support vector machines (SVMs) became the preferred choices in the 1990s and 2000s, because of artificial neural networks' computational cost and a lack of understanding of how the brain wires its biological networks. [ citation needed ] In 2003, LSTM became competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks. [ 93 ] In 2006, Alex Graves , Santiago Fernández, Faustino Gomez, and Schmidhuber combined it with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) [ 94 ] in stacks of LSTMs. [ 95 ] In 2009, it became the first RNN to win a pattern recognition contest, in connected handwriting recognition . [ 96 ] [ 9 ] In 2006, publications by Geoff Hinton , Ruslan Salakhutdinov , Osindero and Teh [ 97 ] [ 98 ] deep belief networks were developed for generative modeling. They are trained by training one restricted Boltzmann machine, then freezing it and training another one on top of the first one, and so on, then optionally fine-tuned using supervised backpropagation. [ 99 ] They could model high-dimensional probability distributions, such as the distribution of MNIST images , but convergence was slow. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] [ 102 ] The impact of deep learning in industry began in the early 2000s, when CNNs already processed an estimated 10% to 20% of all the checks written in the US, according to Yann LeCun. [ 103 ] Industrial applications of deep learning to large-scale speech recognition started around 2010. The 2009 NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning for Speech Recognition was motivated by the limitations of deep generative models of speech, and the possibility that given more capable hardware and large-scale data sets that deep neural nets might become practical. It was believed that pre-training DNNs using generative models of deep belief nets (DBN) would overcome the main difficulties of neural nets. However, it was discovered that replacing pre-training with large amounts of training data for straightforward backpropagation when using DNNs with large, context-dependent output layers produced error rates dramatically lower than then-state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture model (GMM)/Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and also than more-advanced generative model-based systems. [ 104 ] The nature of the recognition errors produced by the two types of systems was characteristically different, [ 105 ] offering technical insights into how to integrate deep learning into the existing highly efficient, run-time speech decoding system deployed by all major speech recognition systems. [ 23 ] [ 106 ] [ 107 ] Analysis around 2009–2010, contrasting the GMM (and other generative speech models) vs. DNN models, stimulated early industrial investment in deep learning for speech recognition. [ 105 ] That analysis was done with comparable performance (less than 1.5% in error rate) between discriminative DNNs and generative models. [ 104 ] [ 105 ] [ 108 ] In 2010, researchers extended deep learning from TIMIT to large vocabulary speech recognition, by adopting large output layers of the DNN based on context-dependent HMM states constructed by decision trees . [ 109 ] [ 110 ] [ 111 ] [ 106 ] Deep learning revolution [ edit source ] How deep learning is a subset of machine learning and how machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) The deep learning revolution started around CNN- and GPU-based computer vision. Although CNNs trained by backpropagation had been around for decades and GPU implementations of NNs for years, [ 112 ] including CNNs, [ 113 ] faster implementations of CNNs on GPUs were needed to progress on computer vision. Later, as deep learning becomes widespread, specialized hardware and algorithm optimizations were developed specifically for deep learning. [ 114 ] A key advance for the deep learning revolution was hardware advances, especially GPU. Some early work dated back to 2004. [ 112 ] [ 113 ] In 2009, Raina, Madhavan, and Andrew Ng reported a 100M deep belief network trained on 30 Nvidia GeForce GTX 280 GPUs, an early demonstration of GPU-based deep learning. They reported up to 70 times faster training. [ 115 ] In 2011, a CNN named DanNet [ 116 ] [ 117 ] by Dan Ciresan, Ueli Meier, Jonathan Masci, Luca Maria Gambardella , and Jürgen Schmidhuber achieved for the first time superhuman performance in a visual pattern recognition contest, outperforming traditional methods by a factor of 3. [ 9 ] It then won more contests. [ 118 ] [ 119 ] They also showed how max-pooling CNNs on GPU improved performance significantly. [ 3 ] In 2012, Andrew Ng and Jeff Dean created an FNN that learned to recognize higher-level concepts, such as cats, only from watching unlabeled images taken from YouTube videos. [ 120 ] In October 2012, AlexNet by Alex Krizhevsky , Ilya Sutskever , and Geoffrey Hinton [ 4 ] won the large-scale ImageNet competition by a significant margin over shallow machine learning methods. Further incremental improvements included the VGG-16 network by Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman [ 121 ] and Google's Inceptionv3 . [ 122 ] The success in image classification was then extended to the more challenging task of generating descriptions (captions) for images, often as a combination of CNNs and LSTMs. [ 123 ] [ 124 ] [ 125 ] In 2014, the state of the art was training “very deep neural network” with 20 to 30 layers.

[ 128 ] In 2015, two techniques were developed to train very deep networks: the Highway Network was published in May 2015, and the residual neural network (ResNet) [ 129 ] in Dec 2015. ResNet behaves like an open-gated Highway Net. Around the same time, deep learning started impacting the field of art. Early examples included Google DeepDream (2015), and neural style transfer (2015), [ 130 ] both of which were based on pretrained image classification neural networks, such as VGG-19 . Generative adversarial network (GAN) by ( Ian Goodfellow et al., 2014) [ 131 ] (based on Jürgen Schmidhuber 's principle of artificial curiosity [ 74 ] [ 76 ] ) became state of the art in generative modeling during 2014-2018 period. Excellent image quality is achieved by Nvidia 's StyleGAN (2018) [ 132 ] based on the Progressive GAN by Tero Karras et al. [ 133 ] Here the GAN generator is grown from small to large scale in a pyramidal fashion. Image generation by GAN reached popular success, and provoked discussions concerning deepfakes . [ 134 ] Diffusion models (2015) [ 135 ] eclipsed GANs in generative modeling since then, with systems such as DALL·E 2 (2022) and Stable Diffusion (2022). In 2015, Google's speech recognition improved by 49% by an LSTM-based model, which they made available through Google Voice Search on smartphone . [ 136 ] [ 137 ] Deep learning is part of state-of-the-art systems in various disciplines, particularly computer vision and automatic speech recognition (ASR). Results on commonly used evaluation sets such as TIMIT (ASR) and MNIST ( image classification ), as well as a range of large-vocabulary speech recognition tasks have steadily improved. [ 104 ] [ 138 ] Convolutional neural networks were superseded for ASR by LSTM . [ 137 ] [ 139 ] [ 140 ] [ 141 ] but are more successful in computer vision. Yoshua Bengio , Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun were awarded the 2018 Turing Award for \"conceptual and engineering breakthroughs that have made deep neural networks a critical component of computing\". [ 142 ] Neural networks [ edit source ] Main article: Artificial neural network Simplified example of training a neural network in object detection: The network is trained by multiple images that are known to depict starfish and sea urchins , which are correlated with \"nodes\" that represent visual features . The starfish match with a ringed texture and a star outline, whereas most sea urchins match with a striped texture and oval shape. However, the instance of a ring textured sea urchin creates a weakly weighted association between them. Subsequent run of the network on an input image (left): [ 143 ] The network correctly detects the starfish. However, the weakly weighted association between ringed texture and sea urchin also confers a weak signal to the latter from one of two intermediate nodes. In addition, a shell that was not included in the training gives a weak signal for the oval shape, also resulting in a weak signal for the sea urchin output. These weak signals may result in a false positive result for sea urchin. In reality, textures and outlines would not be represented by single nodes, but rather by associated weight patterns of multiple nodes. Artificial neural networks ( ANNs ) or connectionist systems are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems learn (progressively improve their ability) to do tasks by considering examples, generally without task-specific programming. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

They have found most use in applications difficult to express with a traditional computer algorithm using rule-based programming . An ANN is based on a collection of connected units called artificial neurons , (analogous to biological neurons in a biological brain ). Each connection ( synapse ) between neurons can transmit a signal to another neuron. The receiving (postsynaptic) neuron can process the signal(s) and then signal downstream neurons connected to it. Neurons may have state, generally represented by real numbers , typically between 0 and 1. Neurons and synapses may also have a weight that varies as learning proceeds, which can increase or decrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream. Typically, neurons are organized in layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first (input), to the last (output) layer, possibly after traversing the layers multiple times. The original goal of the neural network approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. Over time, attention focused on matching specific mental abilities, leading to deviations from biology such as backpropagation , or passing information in the reverse direction and adjusting the network to reflect that information. Neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition , machine translation , social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis. As of 2017, neural networks typically have a few thousand to a few million units and millions of connections. Despite this number being several order of magnitude less than the number of neurons on a human brain, these networks can perform many tasks at a level beyond that of humans (e.g., recognizing faces, or playing \"Go\" [ 144 ] ). Deep neural networks [ edit source ] A deep neural network (DNN) is an artificial neural network with multiple layers between the input and output layers. [ 7 ] [ 9 ] There are different types of neural networks but they always consist of the same components: neurons, synapses, weights, biases, and functions. [ 145 ] These components as a whole function in a way that mimics functions of the human brain, and can be trained like any other ML algorithm. [ citation needed ] For example, a DNN that is trained to recognize dog breeds will go over the given image and calculate the probability that the dog in the image is a certain breed. The user can review the results and select which probabilities the network should display (above a certain threshold, etc.) and return the proposed label. Each mathematical manipulation as such is considered a layer, [ 146 ] and complex DNN have many layers, hence the name \"deep\" networks. DNNs can model complex non-linear relationships. DNN architectures generate compositional models where the object is expressed as a layered composition of primitives . [ 147 ] The extra layers enable composition of features from lower layers, potentially modeling complex data with fewer units than a similarly performing shallow network. [ 7 ] For instance, it was proved that sparse multivariate polynomials are exponentially easier to approximate with DNNs than with shallow networks.

[ 149 ] That way the algorithm can make certain parameters more influential, until it determines the correct mathematical manipulation to fully process the data. Recurrent neural networks , in which data can flow in any direction, are used for applications such as language modeling .

[ 157 ] CNNs also have been applied to acoustic modeling for automatic speech recognition (ASR). [ 158 ] Challenges [ edit source ] As with ANNs, many issues can arise with naively trained DNNs. Two common issues are overfitting and computation time. DNNs are prone to overfitting because of the added layers of abstraction, which allow them to model rare dependencies in the training data. Regularization methods such as Ivakhnenko's unit pruning [ 41 ] or weight decay ( ℓ 2 {\\displaystyle \\ell _{2}} -regularization) or sparsity ( ℓ 1 {\\displaystyle \\ell _{1}} -regularization) can be applied during training to combat overfitting.

[ 162 ] DNNs must consider many training parameters, such as the size (number of layers and number of units per layer), the learning rate , and initial weights. Sweeping through the parameter space for optimal parameters may not be feasible due to the cost in time and computational resources. Various tricks, such as batching (computing the gradient on several training examples at once rather than individual examples) [ 163 ] speed up computation. Large processing capabilities of many-core architectures (such as GPUs or the Intel Xeon Phi) have produced significant speedups in training, because of the suitability of such processing architectures for the matrix and vector computations.

[ 168 ] By 2019, graphics processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method for training large-scale commercial cloud AI . [ 169 ] OpenAI estimated the hardware computation used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017) and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of computation required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months. [ 170 ] [ 171 ] Special electronic circuits called deep learning processors were designed to speed up deep learning algorithms. Deep learning processors include neural processing units (NPUs) in Huawei cellphones [ 172 ] and cloud computing servers such as tensor processing units (TPU) in the Google Cloud Platform . [ 173 ] Cerebras Systems has also built a dedicated system to handle large deep learning models, the CS-2, based on the largest processor in the industry, the second-generation Wafer Scale Engine (WSE-2). [ 174 ] [ 175 ] Atomically thin semiconductors are considered promising for energy-efficient deep learning hardware where the same basic device structure is used for both logic operations and data storage. In 2020, Marega et al. published experiments with a large-area active channel material for developing logic-in-memory devices and circuits based on floating-gate field-effect transistors (FGFETs). [ 176 ] In 2021, J. Feldmann et al. proposed an integrated photonic hardware accelerator for parallel convolutional processing. [ 177 ] The authors identify two key advantages of integrated photonics over its electronic counterparts: (1) massively parallel data transfer through wavelength division multiplexing in conjunction with frequency combs , and (2) extremely high data modulation speeds. [ 177 ] Their system can execute trillions of multiply-accumulate operations per second, indicating the potential of integrated photonics in data-heavy AI applications.

LSTM RNNs can learn \"Very Deep Learning\" tasks [ 9 ] that involve multi-second intervals containing speech events separated by thousands of discrete time steps, where one time step corresponds to about 10 ms. LSTM with forget gates [ 156 ] is competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks. [ 93 ] The initial success in speech recognition was based on small-scale recognition tasks based on TIMIT. The data set contains 630 speakers from eight major dialects of American English , where each speaker reads 10 sentences. [ 178 ] Its small size lets many configurations be tried. More importantly, the TIMIT task concerns phone -sequence recognition, which, unlike word-sequence recognition, allows weak phone bigram language models. This lets the strength of the acoustic modeling aspects of speech recognition be more easily analyzed.

Word embedding, such as word2vec , can be thought of as a representational layer in a deep learning architecture that transforms an atomic word into a positional representation of the word relative to other words in the dataset; the position is represented as a point in a vector space . Using word embedding as an RNN input layer allows the network to parse sentences and phrases using an effective compositional vector grammar.

[ 227 ] In medical informatics, deep learning was used to predict sleep quality based on data from wearables [ 228 ] and predictions of health complications from electronic health record data. [ 229 ] Deep neural networks have shown unparalleled performance in predicting protein structure , according to the sequence of the amino acids that make it up. In 2020, AlphaFold , a deep-learning based system, achieved a level of accuracy significantly higher than all previous computational methods. [ 230 ] [ 231 ] Deep Neural Network Estimations [ edit source ] Deep neural networks can be used to estimate the entropy of a stochastic process and called Neural Joint Entropy Estimator (NJEE). [ 232 ] Such an estimation provides insights on the effects of input random variables on an independent random variable . Practically, the DNN is trained as a classifier that maps an input vector or matrix X to an output probability distribution over the possible classes of random variable Y, given input X. For example, in image classification tasks, the NJEE maps a vector of pixels ' color values to probabilities over possible image classes. In practice, the probability distribution of Y is obtained by a Softmax layer with number of nodes that is equal to the alphabet size of Y. NJEE uses continuously differentiable activation functions , such that the conditions for the universal approximation theorem holds. It is shown that this method provides a strongly consistent estimator and outperforms other methods in case of large alphabet sizes. [ 232 ] Medical image analysis [ edit source ] Deep learning has been shown to produce competitive results in medical application such as cancer cell classification, lesion detection, organ segmentation and image enhancement.

This information can form the basis of machine learning to improve ad selection. Image restoration [ edit source ] Deep learning has been successfully applied to inverse problems such as denoising , super-resolution , inpainting , and film colorization . [ 238 ] These applications include learning methods such as \"Shrinkage Fields for Effective Image Restoration\" [ 239 ] which trains on an image dataset, and Deep Image Prior , which trains on the image that needs restoration. Financial fraud detection [ edit source ] Deep learning is being successfully applied to financial fraud detection , tax evasion detection, [ 240 ] and anti-money laundering. [ 241 ] Materials science [ edit source ] In November 2023, researchers at Google DeepMind and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory announced that they had developed an AI system known as GNoME. This system has contributed to materials science by discovering over 2 million new materials within a relatively short timeframe. GNoME employs deep learning techniques to efficiently explore potential material structures, achieving a significant increase in the identification of stable inorganic crystal structures . The system's predictions were validated through autonomous robotic experiments, demonstrating a noteworthy success rate of 71%. The data of newly discovered materials is publicly available through the Materials Project database, offering researchers the opportunity to identify materials with desired properties for various applications. This development has implications for the future of scientific discovery and the integration of AI in material science research, potentially expediting material innovation and reducing costs in product development. The use of AI and deep learning suggests the possibility of minimizing or eliminating manual lab experiments and allowing scientists to focus more on the design and analysis of unique compounds. [ 242 ] [ 243 ] [ 244 ] Military [ edit source ] The United States Department of Defense applied deep learning to train robots in new tasks through observation. [ 245 ] Partial differential equations [ edit source ] Physics informed neural networks have been used to solve partial differential equations in both forward and inverse problems in a data driven manner. [ 246 ] One example is the reconstructing fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equations . Using physics informed neural networks does not require the often expensive mesh generation that conventional CFD methods rely on. [ 247 ] [ 248 ] Deep backward stochastic differential equation method [ edit source ] Deep backward stochastic differential equation method is a numerical method that combines deep learning with Backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE). This method is particularly useful for solving high-dimensional problems in financial mathematics. By leveraging the powerful function approximation capabilities of deep neural networks , deep BSDE addresses the computational challenges faced by traditional numerical methods in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, traditional methods like finite difference methods or Monte Carlo simulations often struggle with the curse of dimensionality, where computational cost increases exponentially with the number of dimensions. Deep BSDE methods, however, employ deep neural networks to approximate solutions of high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), effectively reducing the computational burden. [ 249 ] In addition, the integration of Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) into the deep BSDE framework enhances its capability by embedding the underlying physical laws directly into the neural network architecture. This ensures that the solutions not only fit the data but also adhere to the governing stochastic differential equations. PINNs leverage the power of deep learning while respecting the constraints imposed by the physical models, resulting in more accurate and reliable solutions for financial mathematics problems. Image reconstruction [ edit source ] Image reconstruction is the reconstruction of the underlying images from the image-related measurements. Several works showed the better and superior performance of the deep learning methods compared to analytical methods for various applications, e.g., spectral imaging [ 250 ] and ultrasound imaging. [ 251 ] Weather prediction [ edit source ] Traditional weather prediction systems solve a very complex system of partial differential equations. GraphCast is a deep learning based model, trained on a long history of weather data to predict how weather patterns change over time. It is able to predict weather conditions for up to 10 days globally, at a very detailed level, and in under a minute, with precision similar to state of the art systems. [ 252 ] [ 253 ] Epigenetic clock [ edit source ] Main article: Epigenetic clock An epigenetic clock is a biochemical test that can be used to measure age. Galkin et al. used deep neural networks to train an epigenetic aging clock of unprecedented accuracy using >6,000 blood samples. [ 254 ] The clock uses information from 1000 CpG sites and predicts people with certain conditions older than healthy controls: IBD , frontotemporal dementia , ovarian cancer , obesity . The aging clock was planned to be released for public use in 2021 by an Insilico Medicine spinoff company Deep Longevity. Relation to human cognitive and brain development [ edit source ] Deep learning is closely related to a class of theories of brain development (specifically, neocortical development) proposed by cognitive neuroscientists in the early 1990s. [ 255 ] [ 256 ] [ 257 ] [ 258 ] These developmental theories were instantiated in computational models, making them predecessors of deep learning systems. These developmental models share the property that various proposed learning dynamics in the brain (e.g., a wave of nerve growth factor ) support the self-organization somewhat analogous to the neural networks utilized in deep learning models. Like the neocortex , neural networks employ a hierarchy of layered filters in which each layer considers information from a prior layer (or the operating environment), and then passes its output (and possibly the original input), to other layers. This process yields a self-organizing stack of transducers , well-tuned to their operating environment. A 1995 description stated, \"...the infant's brain seems to organize itself under the influence of waves of so-called trophic-factors ... different regions of the brain become connected sequentially, with one layer of tissue maturing before another and so on until the whole brain is mature\". [ 259 ] A variety of approaches have been used to investigate the plausibility of deep learning models from a neurobiological perspective. On the one hand, several variants of the backpropagation algorithm have been proposed in order to increase its processing realism. [ 260 ] [ 261 ] Other researchers have argued that unsupervised forms of deep learning, such as those based on hierarchical generative models and deep belief networks , may be closer to biological reality. [ 262 ] [ 263 ] In this respect, generative neural network models have been related to neurobiological evidence about sampling-based processing in the cerebral cortex. [ 264 ] Although a systematic comparison between the human brain organization and the neuronal encoding in deep networks has not yet been established, several analogies have been reported. For example, the computations performed by deep learning units could be similar to those of actual neurons [ 265 ] and neural populations. [ 266 ] Similarly, the representations developed by deep learning models are similar to those measured in the primate visual system [ 267 ] both at the single-unit [ 268 ] and at the population [ 269 ] levels.", "strategy": "semantic"}

(*) To understand more about it, see the section Benchmarks. ## Dependencies { #dependencies } FastAPI depends on Pydantic and Starlette. ### `standard` Dependencies { #standard-dependencies } When you install FastAPI with `pip install \"fastapi[standard]\"` it comes with the `standard` group of optional dependencies: Used by Pydantic: * `email- validator` \\- for email validation. Used by Starlette: * `httpx` \\- Required if you want to use the `TestClient`. * `jinja2` \\- Required if you want to use the default template configuration. * `python-multipart` \\- Required if you want to support form \"parsing\", with `request.form()`. Used by FastAPI: * `uvicorn` \\- for the server that loads and serves your application. This includes `uvicorn[standard]`, which includes some dependencies (e.g. `uvloop`) needed for high performance serving. * `fastapi-cli[standard]` - to provide the `fastapi` command. * This includes `fastapi-cloud-cli`, which allows you to deploy your FastAPI application to FastAPI Cloud. ### Without `standard` Dependencies { #without-standard-dependencies } If you don't want to include the `standard` optional dependencies, you can install with `pip install fastapi` instead of `pip install \"fastapi[standard]\"`. ### Without `fastapi- cloud-cli` { #without-fastapi-cloud-cli } If you want to install FastAPI with the standard dependencies but without the `fastapi-cloud-cli`, you can install with `pip install \"fastapi[standard-no-fastapi-cloud-cli]\"`. ### Additional Optional Dependencies { #additional-optional-dependencies } There are some additional dependencies you might want to install. Additional optional Pydantic dependencies: * `pydantic-settings` \\- for settings management. * `pydantic-extra-types` \\- for extra types to be used with Pydantic. Additional optional FastAPI dependencies: * `orjson` \\- Required if you want to use `ORJSONResponse`. * `ujson` \\- Required if you want to use `UJSONResponse`. ## License { #license } This project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.", "strategy": "semantic"}

The application of ML to business problems is known as predictive analytics . Statistics and mathematical optimisation (mathematical programming) methods comprise the foundations of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) via unsupervised learning . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] From a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct learning provides a framework for describing machine learning. History [ edit ] See also: Timeline of machine learning The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel , an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The synonym self-teaching computers was also used in this time period. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The earliest machine learning program was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a computer program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, but the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes. [ 10 ] In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior , in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells . [ 11 ] Hebb's model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data. [ 10 ] Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch , who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes. [ 10 ] By the early 1960s, an experimental \"learning machine\" with punched tape memory, called Cybertron, had been developed by Raytheon Company to analyse sonar signals, electrocardiograms , and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning . It was repetitively \"trained\" by a human operator/teacher to recognise patterns and equipped with a \" goof \" button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions. [ 12 ] A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification. [ 13 ] Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973. [ 14 ] In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognise 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal. [ 15 ] Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T , as measured by P , improves with experience E .\" [ 16 ] This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing 's proposal in his paper \" Computing Machinery and Intelligence \", in which the question \"Can machines think?\" is replaced with the question \"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\". [ 17 ] Modern day Machine Learning algorithms are broken into 3 algorithms types: Supervised Learning Algorithms, Unsupervised Learning Algorithms, and Reinforcement Learning Algorithms. [ 18 ] Current Supervised Learning Algorithms have objectives of classification and regression. Current Unsupervised Learning Algorithms have objectives of clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association rule. Current Reinforcement Learning Algorithms focus on decisions that must be made with respect to some previous, unkown time and are broken down to either be studies of model based methods, and model free methods. Relationships to other fields [ edit ] Artificial intelligence [ edit ] Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence .

They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed \" neural networks \"; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalised linear models of statistics. [ 20 ] Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis . [ 21 ] : 488 However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation. [ 21 ] : 488 By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favour. [ 22 ] Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming (ILP), but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval .

[ 22 ] Data compression [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from Data compression § Machine learning . [ edit ] There is a close connection between machine learning and compression. A system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression (by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution). Conversely, an optimal compressor can be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that compresses best, given the previous history). This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for \"general intelligence\". [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] An alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit feature space vectors , and compression-based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces. For each compressor C(.) we define an associated vector space ℵ, such that C(.) maps an input string x, corresponding to the vector norm ||~x||. An exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space; instead, feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods, LZW, LZ77, and PPM. [ 26 ] According to AIXI theory, a connection more directly explained in Hutter Prize , the best possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x. For example, in that model, a zip file's compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software, since you can not unzip it without both, but there may be an even smaller combined form. Examples of AI-powered audio/video compression software include NVIDIA Maxine , AIVC. [ 27 ] Examples of software that can perform AI-powered image compression include OpenCV , TensorFlow , MATLAB 's Image Processing Toolbox (IPT) and High-Fidelity Generative Image Compression. [ 28 ] In unsupervised machine learning , k-means clustering can be utilized to compress data by grouping similar data points into clusters. This technique simplifies handling extensive datasets that lack predefined labels and finds widespread use in fields such as image compression . [ 29 ] Data compression aims to reduce the size of data files, enhancing storage efficiency and speeding up data transmission. K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, is employed to partition a dataset into a specified number of clusters, k, each represented by the centroid of its points. This process condenses extensive datasets into a more compact set of representative points. Particularly beneficial in image and signal processing , k-means clustering aids in data reduction by replacing groups of data points with their centroids, thereby preserving the core information of the original data while significantly decreasing the required storage space. [ 30 ] Large language models (LLMs) are also efficient lossless data compressors on some data sets, as demonstrated by DeepMind 's research with the Chinchilla 70B model. Developed by DeepMind, Chinchilla 70B effectively compressed data, outperforming conventional methods such as Portable Network Graphics (PNG) for images and Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) for audio. It achieved compression of image and audio data to 43.4% and 16.4% of their original sizes, respectively. There is, however, some reason to be concerned that the data set used for testing overlaps the LLM training data set, making it possible that the Chinchilla 70B model is only an efficient compression tool on data it has already been trained on. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] Data mining [ edit ] Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as \" unsupervised learning \" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data. Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimisation : Many learning problems are formulated as minimisation of some loss function on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples). [ 33 ] Generalization [ edit ] Characterizing the generalisation of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research, especially for deep learning algorithms. Statistics [ edit ] Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population inferences from a sample , while machine learning finds generalisable predictive patterns. [ 34 ] Conventional statistical analyses require the a priori selection of a model most suitable for the study data set. In addition, only significant or theoretically relevant variables based on previous experience are included for analysis. In contrast, machine learning is not built on a pre-structured model; rather, the data shape the model by detecting underlying patterns. The more variables (input) used to train the model, the more accurate the ultimate model will be. [ 35 ] Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modelling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model, [ 36 ] wherein \"algorithmic model\" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random Forest . Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning . [ 37 ] Statistical physics [ edit ] Analytical and computational techniques derived from deep-rooted physics of disordered systems can be extended to large-scale problems, including machine learning, e.g., to analyse the weight space of deep neural networks . [ 38 ] Statistical physics is thus finding applications in the area of medical diagnostics . [ 39 ] Theory [ edit ] Main articles: Computational learning theory and Statistical learning theory A core objective of a learner is to generalise from its experience. [ 3 ] [ 40 ] Generalisation in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases. The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory via the probably approximately correct learning model. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The bias–variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalisation error . For the best performance in the context of generalisation, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalisation will be poorer. [ 41 ] In addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time . There are two kinds of time complexity results: Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time. Approaches [ edit ] In supervised learning , the training data is labelled with the expected answers, while in unsupervised learning , the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data. Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, which correspond to learning paradigms, depending on the nature of the \"signal\" or \"feedback\" available to the learning system: Supervised learning : The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a \"teacher\", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. Unsupervised learning : No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end ( feature learning ). Reinforcement learning : A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximise. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] Supervised learning [ edit ] Main article: Supervised learning A support-vector machine is a supervised learning model that divides the data into regions separated by a linear boundary . Here, the linear boundary divides the black circles from the white. Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs. [ 45 ] The data, known as training data , consists of a set of training examples. Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output, also known as a supervisory signal. In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an array or vector, sometimes called a feature vector , and the training data is represented by a matrix . Through iterative optimisation of an objective function , supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs. [ 46 ] An optimal function allows the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data. An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task. [ 16 ] Types of supervised-learning algorithms include active learning , classification and regression . [ 47 ] Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, while regression algorithms are used when the outputs can take any numerical value within a range. For example, in a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input is an incoming email, and the output is the folder in which to file the email. In contrast, regression is used for tasks such as predicting a person's height based on factors like age and genetics or forecasting future temperatures based on historical data. [ 48 ] Similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are. It has applications in ranking , recommendation systems , visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification. Unsupervised learning [ edit ] Main article: Unsupervised learning See also: Cluster analysis Unsupervised learning algorithms find structures in data that has not been labelled, classified or categorised. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data. Central applications of unsupervised machine learning include clustering, dimensionality reduction , [ 5 ] and density estimation . [ 49 ] Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters ) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated, for example, by internal compactness , or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and separation , the difference between clusters. Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity . A special type of unsupervised learning called, self-supervised learning involves training a model by generating the supervisory signal from the data itself. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] Semi-supervised learning [ edit ] Main article: Semi-supervised learning Semi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning (without any labelled training data) and supervised learning (with completely labelled training data). Some of the training examples are missing training labels, yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabelled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labelled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy. In weakly supervised learning , the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets. [ 52 ] Reinforcement learning [ edit ] Main article: Reinforcement learning Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximise some notion of cumulative reward. Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory , control theory , operations research , information theory , simulation-based optimisation , multi-agent systems , swarm intelligence , statistics and genetic algorithms . In reinforcement learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov decision process (MDP). Many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques. [ 53 ] Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and are used when exact models are infeasible. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

Dimensionality reduction [ edit ] Dimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. [ 54 ] In other words, it is a process of reducing the dimension of the feature set, also called the \"number of features\". Most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or extraction . One of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis (PCA). PCA involves changing higher-dimensional data (e.g., 3D) to a smaller space (e.g., 2D). The manifold hypothesis proposes that high-dimensional data sets lie along low-dimensional manifolds , and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption, leading to the area of manifold learning and manifold regularisation .

The CAA self-learning algorithm computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence situations. The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion. [ 58 ] The self-learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W =||w(a,s)|| such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine: in situation s perform action a receive a consequence situation s ' compute emotion of being in the consequence situation v(s') update crossbar memory w'(a,s) = w(a,s) + v(s') It is a system with only one input, situation, and only one output, action (or behaviour) a. There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment. The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation.

Feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions. This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution. This replaces manual feature engineering , and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task. Feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised. In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labelled input data. Examples include artificial neural networks , multilayer perceptrons , and supervised dictionary learning . In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabelled input data. Examples include dictionary learning, independent component analysis , autoencoders , matrix factorisation [ 61 ] and various forms of clustering . [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ] Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional. Sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse, meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros. Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into higher-dimensional vectors. [ 65 ] Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features. It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data. [ 66 ] Feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process. However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded attempts to algorithmically define specific features. An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination, without relying on explicit algorithms. Sparse dictionary learning [ edit ] Main article: Sparse dictionary learning Sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and assumed to be a sparse matrix . The method is strongly NP-hard and difficult to solve approximately. [ 67 ] A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the k -SVD algorithm. Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs. For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de-noising . The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot. [ 68 ] Anomaly detection [ edit ] Main article: Anomaly detection In data mining , anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data. [ 69 ] Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud , a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are referred to as outliers , novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions. [ 70 ] In particular, in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection, the interesting objects are often not rare objects, but unexpected bursts of inactivity. This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object. Many outlier detection methods (in particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data unless aggregated appropriately. Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns. [ 71 ] Three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist. [ 72 ] Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabelled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit the least to the remainder of the data set. Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labelled as \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" and involves training a classifier (the key difference from many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection). Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behaviour from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model.

Association rules [ edit ] Main article: Association rule learning See also: Inductive logic programming Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of \"interestingness\". [ 75 ] Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves \"rules\" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilisation of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction. [ 76 ] Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems , association rule learning, and artificial immune systems . Based on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal , Tomasz Imieliński and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets. [ 77 ] For example, the rule { o n i o n s , p o t a t o e s } ⇒ { b u r g e r } {\\displaystyle \\{\\mathrm {onions,potatoes} \\}\\Rightarrow \\{\\mathrm {burger} \\}} found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements . In addition to market basket analysis , association rules are employed today in application areas including Web usage mining , intrusion detection , continuous production , and bioinformatics . In contrast with sequence mining , association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions. Learning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a genetic algorithm , with a learning component, performing either supervised learning , reinforcement learning , or unsupervised learning . They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions. [ 78 ] Inductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples. Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs . Inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing . Gordon Plotkin and Ehud Shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting.

The application of ML to business problems is known as predictive analytics . Statistics and mathematical optimisation (mathematical programming) methods comprise the foundations of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) via unsupervised learning . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] From a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct learning provides a framework for describing machine learning. History [ edit ] See also: Timeline of machine learning The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel , an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The synonym self-teaching computers was also used in this time period. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The earliest machine learning program was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a computer program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, but the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes. [ 10 ] In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior , in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells . [ 11 ] Hebb's model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data. [ 10 ] Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch , who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes. [ 10 ] By the early 1960s, an experimental \"learning machine\" with punched tape memory, called Cybertron, had been developed by Raytheon Company to analyse sonar signals, electrocardiograms , and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning . It was repetitively \"trained\" by a human operator/teacher to recognise patterns and equipped with a \" goof \" button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions. [ 12 ] A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification. [ 13 ] Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973. [ 14 ] In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognise 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal. [ 15 ] Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T , as measured by P , improves with experience E .\" [ 16 ] This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing 's proposal in his paper \" Computing Machinery and Intelligence \", in which the question \"Can machines think?\" is replaced with the question \"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\". [ 17 ] Modern day Machine Learning algorithms are broken into 3 algorithms types: Supervised Learning Algorithms, Unsupervised Learning Algorithms, and Reinforcement Learning Algorithms. [ 18 ] Current Supervised Learning Algorithms have objectives of classification and regression. Current Unsupervised Learning Algorithms have objectives of clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association rule. Current Reinforcement Learning Algorithms focus on decisions that must be made with respect to some previous, unkown time and are broken down to either be studies of model based methods, and model free methods. Relationships to other fields [ edit ] Artificial intelligence [ edit ] Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence . [ 19 ] As a scientific endeavour, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence (AI). ", "strategy": "semantic"}

They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed \" neural networks \"; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalised linear models of statistics. [ 20 ] Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis . [ 21 ] : 488 However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation. [ 21 ] : 488 By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favour. [ 22 ] Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming (ILP), but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval . [ 21 ] : 708–710, 755 Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as \" connectionism \", by researchers from other disciplines including John Hopfield , David Rumelhart , and Geoffrey Hinton . Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation . [ 21 ] : 25 Machine learning (ML), reorganised and recognised as its own field, started to flourish in the 1990s.

[ 22 ] Data compression [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from Data compression § Machine learning . [ edit ] There is a close connection between machine learning and compression. A system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression (by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution). Conversely, an optimal compressor can be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that compresses best, given the previous history). This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for \"general intelligence\". [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] An alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit feature space vectors , and compression-based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces. For each compressor C(.) we define an associated vector space ℵ, such that C(.) maps an input string x, corresponding to the vector norm ||~x||. An exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space; instead, feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods, LZW, LZ77, and PPM. [ 26 ] According to AIXI theory, a connection more directly explained in Hutter Prize , the best possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x. For example, in that model, a zip file's compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software, since you can not unzip it without both, but there may be an even smaller combined form. Examples of AI-powered audio/video compression software include NVIDIA Maxine , AIVC. [ 27 ] Examples of software that can perform AI-powered image compression include OpenCV , TensorFlow , MATLAB 's Image Processing Toolbox (IPT) and High-Fidelity Generative Image Compression. [ 28 ] In unsupervised machine learning , k-means clustering can be utilized to compress data by grouping similar data points into clusters. This technique simplifies handling extensive datasets that lack predefined labels and finds widespread use in fields such as image compression . [ 29 ] Data compression aims to reduce the size of data files, enhancing storage efficiency and speeding up data transmission. K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, is employed to partition a dataset into a specified number of clusters, k, each represented by the centroid of its points. This process condenses extensive datasets into a more compact set of representative points. Particularly beneficial in image and signal processing , k-means clustering aids in data reduction by replacing groups of data points with their centroids, thereby preserving the core information of the original data while significantly decreasing the required storage space. [ 30 ] Large language models (LLMs) are also efficient lossless data compressors on some data sets, as demonstrated by DeepMind 's research with the Chinchilla 70B model. Developed by DeepMind, Chinchilla 70B effectively compressed data, outperforming conventional methods such as Portable Network Graphics (PNG) for images and Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) for audio. It achieved compression of image and audio data to 43.4% and 16.4% of their original sizes, respectively. There is, however, some reason to be concerned that the data set used for testing overlaps the LLM training data set, making it possible that the Chinchilla 70B model is only an efficient compression tool on data it has already been trained on. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] Data mining [ edit ] Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as \" unsupervised learning \" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data. Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimisation : Many learning problems are formulated as minimisation of some loss function on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples). [ 33 ] Generalization [ edit ] Characterizing the generalisation of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research, especially for deep learning algorithms. Statistics [ edit ] Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population inferences from a sample , while machine learning finds generalisable predictive patterns. [ 34 ] Conventional statistical analyses require the a priori selection of a model most suitable for the study data set. In addition, only significant or theoretically relevant variables based on previous experience are included for analysis. In contrast, machine learning is not built on a pre-structured model; rather, the data shape the model by detecting underlying patterns. The more variables (input) used to train the model, the more accurate the ultimate model will be. [ 35 ] Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modelling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model, [ 36 ] wherein \"algorithmic model\" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random Forest . Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning . [ 37 ] Statistical physics [ edit ] Analytical and computational techniques derived from deep-rooted physics of disordered systems can be extended to large-scale problems, including machine learning, e.g., to analyse the weight space of deep neural networks . [ 38 ] Statistical physics is thus finding applications in the area of medical diagnostics . [ 39 ] Theory [ edit ] Main articles: Computational learning theory and Statistical learning theory A core objective of a learner is to generalise from its experience. [ 3 ] [ 40 ] Generalisation in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases. The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory via the probably approximately correct learning model. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The bias–variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalisation error . For the best performance in the context of generalisation, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalisation will be poorer. [ 41 ] In addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time . There are two kinds of time complexity results: Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time. Approaches [ edit ] In supervised learning , the training data is labelled with the expected answers, while in unsupervised learning , the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data. Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, which correspond to learning paradigms, depending on the nature of the \"signal\" or \"feedback\" available to the learning system: Supervised learning : The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a \"teacher\", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. Unsupervised learning : No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end ( feature learning ). Reinforcement learning : A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximise. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] Supervised learning [ edit ] Main article: Supervised learning A support-vector machine is a supervised learning model that divides the data into regions separated by a linear boundary . Here, the linear boundary divides the black circles from the white. Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs. [ 45 ] The data, known as training data , consists of a set of training examples. Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output, also known as a supervisory signal. In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an array or vector, sometimes called a feature vector , and the training data is represented by a matrix . Through iterative optimisation of an objective function , supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs. [ 46 ] An optimal function allows the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data. An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task. [ 16 ] Types of supervised-learning algorithms include active learning , classification and regression . [ 47 ] Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, while regression algorithms are used when the outputs can take any numerical value within a range. For example, in a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input is an incoming email, and the output is the folder in which to file the email. In contrast, regression is used for tasks such as predicting a person's height based on factors like age and genetics or forecasting future temperatures based on historical data. [ 48 ] Similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are. It has applications in ranking , recommendation systems , visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification. Unsupervised learning [ edit ] Main article: Unsupervised learning See also: Cluster analysis Unsupervised learning algorithms find structures in data that has not been labelled, classified or categorised. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data. Central applications of unsupervised machine learning include clustering, dimensionality reduction , [ 5 ] and density estimation . [ 49 ] Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters ) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated, for example, by internal compactness , or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and separation , the difference between clusters. Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity . A special type of unsupervised learning called, self-supervised learning involves training a model by generating the supervisory signal from the data itself. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] Semi-supervised learning [ edit ] Main article: Semi-supervised learning Semi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning (without any labelled training data) and supervised learning (with completely labelled training data). Some of the training examples are missing training labels, yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabelled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labelled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy. In weakly supervised learning , the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets. [ 52 ] Reinforcement learning [ edit ] Main article: Reinforcement learning Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximise some notion of cumulative reward. Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory , control theory , operations research , information theory , simulation-based optimisation , multi-agent systems , swarm intelligence , statistics and genetic algorithms . In reinforcement learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov decision process (MDP). Many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques. [ 53 ] Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and are used when exact models are infeasible. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

Dimensionality reduction [ edit ] Dimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. [ 54 ] In other words, it is a process of reducing the dimension of the feature set, also called the \"number of features\". Most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or extraction . One of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis (PCA). PCA involves changing higher-dimensional data (e.g., 3D) to a smaller space (e.g., 2D). The manifold hypothesis proposes that high-dimensional data sets lie along low-dimensional manifolds , and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption, leading to the area of manifold learning and manifold regularisation .

[ 56 ] [ 57 ] It gives a solution to the problem learning without any external reward, by introducing emotion as an internal reward. Emotion is used as state evaluation of a self-learning agent. The CAA self-learning algorithm computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence situations. The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion. [ 58 ] The self-learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W =||w(a,s)|| such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine: in situation s perform action a receive a consequence situation s ' compute emotion of being in the consequence situation v(s') update crossbar memory w'(a,s) = w(a,s) + v(s') It is a system with only one input, situation, and only one output, action (or behaviour) a. There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment. The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation. The CAA exists in two environments, one is the behavioural environment where it behaves, and the other is the genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioural environment.

Feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions. This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution. This replaces manual feature engineering , and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task. Feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised. In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labelled input data. Examples include artificial neural networks , multilayer perceptrons , and supervised dictionary learning . In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabelled input data. Examples include dictionary learning, independent component analysis , autoencoders , matrix factorisation [ 61 ] and various forms of clustering . [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ] Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional. Sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse, meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros. Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into higher-dimensional vectors. [ 65 ] Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features. It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data. [ 66 ] Feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process. However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded attempts to algorithmically define specific features. An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination, without relying on explicit algorithms. Sparse dictionary learning [ edit ] Main article: Sparse dictionary learning Sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and assumed to be a sparse matrix . The method is strongly NP-hard and difficult to solve approximately. [ 67 ] A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the k -SVD algorithm. Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs. For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de-noising . The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot. [ 68 ] Anomaly detection [ edit ] Main article: Anomaly detection In data mining , anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data. [ 69 ] Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud , a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are referred to as outliers , novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions. [ 70 ] In particular, in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection, the interesting objects are often not rare objects, but unexpected bursts of inactivity. This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object. Many outlier detection methods (in particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data unless aggregated appropriately. Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns. [ 71 ] Three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist. [ 72 ] Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabelled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit the least to the remainder of the data set. Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labelled as \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" and involves training a classifier (the key difference from many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection). Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behaviour from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model. Robot learning [ edit ] Robot learning is inspired by a multitude of machine learning methods, starting from supervised learning, reinforcement learning, [ 73 ] [ 74 ] and finally meta-learning (e.g. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

Association rules [ edit ] Main article: Association rule learning See also: Inductive logic programming Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of \"interestingness\". [ 75 ] Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves \"rules\" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilisation of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction. [ 76 ] Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems , association rule learning, and artificial immune systems . Based on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal , Tomasz Imieliński and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets. [ 77 ] For example, the rule { o n i o n s , p o t a t o e s } ⇒ { b u r g e r } {\\displaystyle \\{\\mathrm {onions,potatoes} \\}\\Rightarrow \\{\\mathrm {burger} \\}} found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements . In addition to market basket analysis , association rules are employed today in application areas including Web usage mining , intrusion detection , continuous production , and bioinformatics . In contrast with sequence mining , association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions. Learning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a genetic algorithm , with a learning component, performing either supervised learning , reinforcement learning , or unsupervised learning . They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions. [ 78 ] Inductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples. Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs . Inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing . Gordon Plotkin and Ehud Shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting. [ 79 ] [ 80 ] [ 81 ] Shapiro built their first implementation (Model Inference System) in 1981: a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples. [ 82 ] The term inductive here refers to philosophical induction, suggesting a theory to explain observed facts, rather than mathematical induction , proving a property for all members of a well-ordered set.", "strategy": "semantic"}

The application of ML to business problems is known as predictive analytics . Statistics and mathematical optimisation (mathematical programming) methods comprise the foundations of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) via unsupervised learning . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] From a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct learning provides a framework for describing machine learning. History [ edit ] See also: Timeline of machine learning The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel , an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The synonym self-teaching computers was also used in this time period. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The earliest machine learning program was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a computer program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, but the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes. [ 10 ] In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior , in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells . [ 11 ] Hebb's model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data. [ 10 ] Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch , who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes. [ 10 ] By the early 1960s, an experimental \"learning machine\" with punched tape memory, called Cybertron, had been developed by Raytheon Company to analyse sonar signals, electrocardiograms , and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning . It was repetitively \"trained\" by a human operator/teacher to recognise patterns and equipped with a \" goof \" button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions. [ 12 ] A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification. [ 13 ] Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973. [ 14 ] In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognise 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal. [ 15 ] Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T , as measured by P , improves with experience E .\" [ 16 ] This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing 's proposal in his paper \" Computing Machinery and Intelligence \", in which the question \"Can machines think?\" is replaced with the question \"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\". [ 17 ] Modern day Machine Learning algorithms are broken into 3 algorithms types: Supervised Learning Algorithms, Unsupervised Learning Algorithms, and Reinforcement Learning Algorithms. [ 18 ] Current Supervised Learning Algorithms have objectives of classification and regression. Current Unsupervised Learning Algorithms have objectives of clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association rule. Current Reinforcement Learning Algorithms focus on decisions that must be made with respect to some previous, unkown time and are broken down to either be studies of model based methods, and model free methods. Relationships to other fields [ edit ] Artificial intelligence [ edit ] Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence . [ 19 ] As a scientific endeavour, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence (AI). ", "strategy": "semantic"}

They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed \" neural networks \"; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalised linear models of statistics. [ 20 ] Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis . [ 21 ] : 488 However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation. [ 21 ] : 488 By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favour. [ 22 ] Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming (ILP), but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval . [ 21 ] : 708–710, 755 Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as \" connectionism \", by researchers from other disciplines including John Hopfield , David Rumelhart , and Geoffrey Hinton . Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation . [ 21 ] : 25 Machine learning (ML), reorganised and recognised as its own field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 22 ] Data compression [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from Data compression § Machine learning . [ edit ] There is a close connection between machine learning and compression. A system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression (by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution). Conversely, an optimal compressor can be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that compresses best, given the previous history). This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for \"general intelligence\". [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] An alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit feature space vectors , and compression-based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces. For each compressor C(.) we define an associated vector space ℵ, such that C(.) maps an input string x, corresponding to the vector norm ||~x||. An exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space; instead, feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods, LZW, LZ77, and PPM. [ 26 ] According to AIXI theory, a connection more directly explained in Hutter Prize , the best possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x. For example, in that model, a zip file's compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software, since you can not unzip it without both, but there may be an even smaller combined form. Examples of AI-powered audio/video compression software include NVIDIA Maxine , AIVC. [ 27 ] Examples of software that can perform AI-powered image compression include OpenCV , TensorFlow , MATLAB 's Image Processing Toolbox (IPT) and High-Fidelity Generative Image Compression. [ 28 ] In unsupervised machine learning , k-means clustering can be utilized to compress data by grouping similar data points into clusters. This technique simplifies handling extensive datasets that lack predefined labels and finds widespread use in fields such as image compression . [ 29 ] Data compression aims to reduce the size of data files, enhancing storage efficiency and speeding up data transmission. K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, is employed to partition a dataset into a specified number of clusters, k, each represented by the centroid of its points. This process condenses extensive datasets into a more compact set of representative points. Particularly beneficial in image and signal processing , k-means clustering aids in data reduction by replacing groups of data points with their centroids, thereby preserving the core information of the original data while significantly decreasing the required storage space. [ 30 ] Large language models (LLMs) are also efficient lossless data compressors on some data sets, as demonstrated by DeepMind 's research with the Chinchilla 70B model. Developed by DeepMind, Chinchilla 70B effectively compressed data, outperforming conventional methods such as Portable Network Graphics (PNG) for images and Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) for audio. It achieved compression of image and audio data to 43.4% and 16.4% of their original sizes, respectively. There is, however, some reason to be concerned that the data set used for testing overlaps the LLM training data set, making it possible that the Chinchilla 70B model is only an efficient compression tool on data it has already been trained on. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] Data mining [ edit ] Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as \" unsupervised learning \" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data. Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimisation : Many learning problems are formulated as minimisation of some loss function on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples). [ 33 ] Generalization [ edit ] Characterizing the generalisation of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research, especially for deep learning algorithms. Statistics [ edit ] Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population inferences from a sample , while machine learning finds generalisable predictive patterns. [ 34 ] Conventional statistical analyses require the a priori selection of a model most suitable for the study data set. In addition, only significant or theoretically relevant variables based on previous experience are included for analysis. In contrast, machine learning is not built on a pre-structured model; rather, the data shape the model by detecting underlying patterns. The more variables (input) used to train the model, the more accurate the ultimate model will be. [ 35 ] Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modelling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model, [ 36 ] wherein \"algorithmic model\" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random Forest . Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning . [ 37 ] Statistical physics [ edit ] Analytical and computational techniques derived from deep-rooted physics of disordered systems can be extended to large-scale problems, including machine learning, e.g., to analyse the weight space of deep neural networks . [ 38 ] Statistical physics is thus finding applications in the area of medical diagnostics . [ 39 ] Theory [ edit ] Main articles: Computational learning theory and Statistical learning theory A core objective of a learner is to generalise from its experience. [ 3 ] [ 40 ] Generalisation in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases. The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory via the probably approximately correct learning model. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The bias–variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalisation error . For the best performance in the context of generalisation, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalisation will be poorer. [ 41 ] In addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time . There are two kinds of time complexity results: Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time. Approaches [ edit ] In supervised learning , the training data is labelled with the expected answers, while in unsupervised learning , the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data. Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, which correspond to learning paradigms, depending on the nature of the \"signal\" or \"feedback\" available to the learning system: Supervised learning : The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a \"teacher\", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. Unsupervised learning : No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end ( feature learning ). Reinforcement learning : A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximise. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] Supervised learning [ edit ] Main article: Supervised learning A support-vector machine is a supervised learning model that divides the data into regions separated by a linear boundary . Here, the linear boundary divides the black circles from the white. Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs. [ 45 ] The data, known as training data , consists of a set of training examples. Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output, also known as a supervisory signal. In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an array or vector, sometimes called a feature vector , and the training data is represented by a matrix . Through iterative optimisation of an objective function , supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs. [ 46 ] An optimal function allows the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data. An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task. [ 16 ] Types of supervised-learning algorithms include active learning , classification and regression . [ 47 ] Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, while regression algorithms are used when the outputs can take any numerical value within a range. For example, in a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input is an incoming email, and the output is the folder in which to file the email. In contrast, regression is used for tasks such as predicting a person's height based on factors like age and genetics or forecasting future temperatures based on historical data. [ 48 ] Similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are. It has applications in ranking , recommendation systems , visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification. Unsupervised learning [ edit ] Main article: Unsupervised learning See also: Cluster analysis Unsupervised learning algorithms find structures in data that has not been labelled, classified or categorised. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data. Central applications of unsupervised machine learning include clustering, dimensionality reduction , [ 5 ] and density estimation . [ 49 ] Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters ) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated, for example, by internal compactness , or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and separation , the difference between clusters. Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity . A special type of unsupervised learning called, self-supervised learning involves training a model by generating the supervisory signal from the data itself. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] Semi-supervised learning [ edit ] Main article: Semi-supervised learning Semi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning (without any labelled training data) and supervised learning (with completely labelled training data). Some of the training examples are missing training labels, yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabelled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labelled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy. In weakly supervised learning , the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets. [ 52 ] Reinforcement learning [ edit ] Main article: Reinforcement learning Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximise some notion of cumulative reward. Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory , control theory , operations research , information theory , simulation-based optimisation , multi-agent systems , swarm intelligence , statistics and genetic algorithms . In reinforcement learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov decision process (MDP). Many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques. [ 53 ] Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and are used when exact models are infeasible. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

Dimensionality reduction [ edit ] Dimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. [ 54 ] In other words, it is a process of reducing the dimension of the feature set, also called the \"number of features\". Most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or extraction . One of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis (PCA). PCA involves changing higher-dimensional data (e.g., 3D) to a smaller space (e.g., 2D). The manifold hypothesis proposes that high-dimensional data sets lie along low-dimensional manifolds , and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption, leading to the area of manifold learning and manifold regularisation . Other types [ edit ] Other approaches have been developed which do not fit neatly into this three-fold categorisation, and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system.

[ 55 ] Self-learning [ edit ] Self-learning, as a machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-learning, named crossbar adaptive array (CAA). [ 56 ] [ 57 ] It gives a solution to the problem learning without any external reward, by introducing emotion as an internal reward. Emotion is used as state evaluation of a self-learning agent. The CAA self-learning algorithm computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence situations. The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion. [ 58 ] The self-learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W =||w(a,s)|| such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine: in situation s perform action a receive a consequence situation s ' compute emotion of being in the consequence situation v(s') update crossbar memory w'(a,s) = w(a,s) + v(s') It is a system with only one input, situation, and only one output, action (or behaviour) a. There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment. The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation. The CAA exists in two environments, one is the behavioural environment where it behaves, and the other is the genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioural environment.

Feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions. This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution. This replaces manual feature engineering , and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task. Feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised. In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labelled input data. Examples include artificial neural networks , multilayer perceptrons , and supervised dictionary learning . In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabelled input data. Examples include dictionary learning, independent component analysis , autoencoders , matrix factorisation [ 61 ] and various forms of clustering . [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ] Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional. Sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse, meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros. Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into higher-dimensional vectors. [ 65 ] Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features. It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data. [ 66 ] Feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process. However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded attempts to algorithmically define specific features. An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination, without relying on explicit algorithms. Sparse dictionary learning [ edit ] Main article: Sparse dictionary learning Sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and assumed to be a sparse matrix . The method is strongly NP-hard and difficult to solve approximately. [ 67 ] A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the k -SVD algorithm. Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs. For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de-noising . The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot. [ 68 ] Anomaly detection [ edit ] Main article: Anomaly detection In data mining , anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data. [ 69 ] Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud , a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are referred to as outliers , novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions. [ 70 ] In particular, in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection, the interesting objects are often not rare objects, but unexpected bursts of inactivity. This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object. Many outlier detection methods (in particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data unless aggregated appropriately. Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns. [ 71 ] Three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist. [ 72 ] Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabelled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit the least to the remainder of the data set. Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labelled as \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" and involves training a classifier (the key difference from many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection). Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behaviour from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model. Robot learning [ edit ] Robot learning is inspired by a multitude of machine learning methods, starting from supervised learning, reinforcement learning, [ 73 ] [ 74 ] and finally meta-learning (e.g. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

Association rules [ edit ] Main article: Association rule learning See also: Inductive logic programming Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of \"interestingness\". [ 75 ] Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves \"rules\" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilisation of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction. [ 76 ] Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems , association rule learning, and artificial immune systems . Based on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal , Tomasz Imieliński and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets. [ 77 ] For example, the rule { o n i o n s , p o t a t o e s } ⇒ { b u r g e r } {\\displaystyle \\{\\mathrm {onions,potatoes} \\}\\Rightarrow \\{\\mathrm {burger} \\}} found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements . In addition to market basket analysis , association rules are employed today in application areas including Web usage mining , intrusion detection , continuous production , and bioinformatics . In contrast with sequence mining , association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions. Learning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a genetic algorithm , with a learning component, performing either supervised learning , reinforcement learning , or unsupervised learning . They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions. [ 78 ] Inductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples. Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs . Inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing . Gordon Plotkin and Ehud Shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting. [ 79 ] [ 80 ] [ 81 ] Shapiro built their first implementation (Model Inference System) in 1981: a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples. [ 82 ] The term inductive here refers to philosophical induction, suggesting a theory to explain observed facts, rather than mathematical induction , proving a property for all members of a well-ordered set.", "strategy": "semantic"}

The application of ML to business problems is known as predictive analytics . Statistics and mathematical optimisation (mathematical programming) methods comprise the foundations of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) via unsupervised learning . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] From a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct learning provides a framework for describing machine learning. History [ edit ] See also: Timeline of machine learning The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel , an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The synonym self-teaching computers was also used in this time period. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The earliest machine learning program was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a computer program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, but the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes. [ 10 ] In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior , in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells . [ 11 ] Hebb's model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data. [ 10 ] Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch , who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes. [ 10 ] By the early 1960s, an experimental \"learning machine\" with punched tape memory, called Cybertron, had been developed by Raytheon Company to analyse sonar signals, electrocardiograms , and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning . It was repetitively \"trained\" by a human operator/teacher to recognise patterns and equipped with a \" goof \" button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions. [ 12 ] A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification. [ 13 ] Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973. [ 14 ] In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognise 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal. [ 15 ] Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T , as measured by P , improves with experience E .\" [ 16 ] This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing 's proposal in his paper \" Computing Machinery and Intelligence \", in which the question \"Can machines think?\" is replaced with the question \"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\". [ 17 ] Modern day Machine Learning algorithms are broken into 3 algorithms types: Supervised Learning Algorithms, Unsupervised Learning Algorithms, and Reinforcement Learning Algorithms. [ 18 ] Current Supervised Learning Algorithms have objectives of classification and regression. Current Unsupervised Learning Algorithms have objectives of clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association rule. Current Reinforcement Learning Algorithms focus on decisions that must be made with respect to some previous, unkown time and are broken down to either be studies of model based methods, and model free methods. Relationships to other fields [ edit ] Artificial intelligence [ edit ] Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence . [ 19 ] As a scientific endeavour, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence (AI). ", "strategy": "semantic"}

They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed \" neural networks \"; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalised linear models of statistics. [ 20 ] Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis . [ 21 ] : 488 However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation. [ 21 ] : 488 By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favour. [ 22 ] Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming (ILP), but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval . [ 21 ] : 708–710, 755 Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as \" connectionism \", by researchers from other disciplines including John Hopfield , David Rumelhart , and Geoffrey Hinton . Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation . [ 21 ] : 25 Machine learning (ML), reorganised and recognised as its own field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 22 ] Data compression [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from Data compression § Machine learning . [ edit ] There is a close connection between machine learning and compression. A system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression (by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution). Conversely, an optimal compressor can be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that compresses best, given the previous history). This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for \"general intelligence\". [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] An alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit feature space vectors , and compression-based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces. For each compressor C(.) we define an associated vector space ℵ, such that C(.) maps an input string x, corresponding to the vector norm ||~x||. An exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space; instead, feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods, LZW, LZ77, and PPM. [ 26 ] According to AIXI theory, a connection more directly explained in Hutter Prize , the best possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x. For example, in that model, a zip file's compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software, since you can not unzip it without both, but there may be an even smaller combined form. Examples of AI-powered audio/video compression software include NVIDIA Maxine , AIVC. [ 27 ] Examples of software that can perform AI-powered image compression include OpenCV , TensorFlow , MATLAB 's Image Processing Toolbox (IPT) and High-Fidelity Generative Image Compression. [ 28 ] In unsupervised machine learning , k-means clustering can be utilized to compress data by grouping similar data points into clusters. This technique simplifies handling extensive datasets that lack predefined labels and finds widespread use in fields such as image compression . [ 29 ] Data compression aims to reduce the size of data files, enhancing storage efficiency and speeding up data transmission. K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, is employed to partition a dataset into a specified number of clusters, k, each represented by the centroid of its points. This process condenses extensive datasets into a more compact set of representative points. Particularly beneficial in image and signal processing , k-means clustering aids in data reduction by replacing groups of data points with their centroids, thereby preserving the core information of the original data while significantly decreasing the required storage space. [ 30 ] Large language models (LLMs) are also efficient lossless data compressors on some data sets, as demonstrated by DeepMind 's research with the Chinchilla 70B model. Developed by DeepMind, Chinchilla 70B effectively compressed data, outperforming conventional methods such as Portable Network Graphics (PNG) for images and Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) for audio. It achieved compression of image and audio data to 43.4% and 16.4% of their original sizes, respectively. There is, however, some reason to be concerned that the data set used for testing overlaps the LLM training data set, making it possible that the Chinchilla 70B model is only an efficient compression tool on data it has already been trained on. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] Data mining [ edit ] Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as \" unsupervised learning \" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data. Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimisation : Many learning problems are formulated as minimisation of some loss function on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples). [ 33 ] Generalization [ edit ] Characterizing the generalisation of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research, especially for deep learning algorithms. Statistics [ edit ] Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population inferences from a sample , while machine learning finds generalisable predictive patterns. [ 34 ] Conventional statistical analyses require the a priori selection of a model most suitable for the study data set. In addition, only significant or theoretically relevant variables based on previous experience are included for analysis. In contrast, machine learning is not built on a pre-structured model; rather, the data shape the model by detecting underlying patterns. The more variables (input) used to train the model, the more accurate the ultimate model will be. [ 35 ] Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modelling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model, [ 36 ] wherein \"algorithmic model\" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random Forest . Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning . [ 37 ] Statistical physics [ edit ] Analytical and computational techniques derived from deep-rooted physics of disordered systems can be extended to large-scale problems, including machine learning, e.g., to analyse the weight space of deep neural networks . [ 38 ] Statistical physics is thus finding applications in the area of medical diagnostics . [ 39 ] Theory [ edit ] Main articles: Computational learning theory and Statistical learning theory A core objective of a learner is to generalise from its experience. [ 3 ] [ 40 ] Generalisation in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases. The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory via the probably approximately correct learning model. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The bias–variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalisation error . For the best performance in the context of generalisation, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalisation will be poorer. [ 41 ] In addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time . There are two kinds of time complexity results: Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time. Approaches [ edit ] In supervised learning , the training data is labelled with the expected answers, while in unsupervised learning , the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data. Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, which correspond to learning paradigms, depending on the nature of the \"signal\" or \"feedback\" available to the learning system: Supervised learning : The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a \"teacher\", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. Unsupervised learning : No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end ( feature learning ). Reinforcement learning : A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximise. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] Supervised learning [ edit ] Main article: Supervised learning A support-vector machine is a supervised learning model that divides the data into regions separated by a linear boundary . Here, the linear boundary divides the black circles from the white. Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs. [ 45 ] The data, known as training data , consists of a set of training examples. Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output, also known as a supervisory signal. In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an array or vector, sometimes called a feature vector , and the training data is represented by a matrix . Through iterative optimisation of an objective function , supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs. [ 46 ] An optimal function allows the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data. An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task. [ 16 ] Types of supervised-learning algorithms include active learning , classification and regression . [ 47 ] Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, while regression algorithms are used when the outputs can take any numerical value within a range. For example, in a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input is an incoming email, and the output is the folder in which to file the email. In contrast, regression is used for tasks such as predicting a person's height based on factors like age and genetics or forecasting future temperatures based on historical data. [ 48 ] Similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are. It has applications in ranking , recommendation systems , visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification. Unsupervised learning [ edit ] Main article: Unsupervised learning See also: Cluster analysis Unsupervised learning algorithms find structures in data that has not been labelled, classified or categorised. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data. Central applications of unsupervised machine learning include clustering, dimensionality reduction , [ 5 ] and density estimation . [ 49 ] Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters ) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated, for example, by internal compactness , or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and separation , the difference between clusters. Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity . A special type of unsupervised learning called, self-supervised learning involves training a model by generating the supervisory signal from the data itself. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] Semi-supervised learning [ edit ] Main article: Semi-supervised learning Semi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning (without any labelled training data) and supervised learning (with completely labelled training data). Some of the training examples are missing training labels, yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabelled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labelled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy. In weakly supervised learning , the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets. [ 52 ] Reinforcement learning [ edit ] Main article: Reinforcement learning Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximise some notion of cumulative reward. Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory , control theory , operations research , information theory , simulation-based optimisation , multi-agent systems , swarm intelligence , statistics and genetic algorithms . In reinforcement learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov decision process (MDP). Many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques. [ 53 ] Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and are used when exact models are infeasible. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

Dimensionality reduction [ edit ] Dimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. [ 54 ] In other words, it is a process of reducing the dimension of the feature set, also called the \"number of features\". Most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or extraction . One of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis (PCA). PCA involves changing higher-dimensional data (e.g., 3D) to a smaller space (e.g., 2D). The manifold hypothesis proposes that high-dimensional data sets lie along low-dimensional manifolds , and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption, leading to the area of manifold learning and manifold regularisation . Other types [ edit ] Other approaches have been developed which do not fit neatly into this three-fold categorisation, and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system.

[ 56 ] [ 57 ] It gives a solution to the problem learning without any external reward, by introducing emotion as an internal reward. Emotion is used as state evaluation of a self-learning agent. The CAA self-learning algorithm computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence situations. The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion. [ 58 ] The self-learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W =||w(a,s)|| such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine: in situation s perform action a receive a consequence situation s ' compute emotion of being in the consequence situation v(s') update crossbar memory w'(a,s) = w(a,s) + v(s') It is a system with only one input, situation, and only one output, action (or behaviour) a. There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment. The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation. The CAA exists in two environments, one is the behavioural environment where it behaves, and the other is the genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioural environment.

Feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions. This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution. This replaces manual feature engineering , and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task. Feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised. In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labelled input data. Examples include artificial neural networks , multilayer perceptrons , and supervised dictionary learning . In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabelled input data. Examples include dictionary learning, independent component analysis , autoencoders , matrix factorisation [ 61 ] and various forms of clustering . [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ] Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional. Sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse, meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros. Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into higher-dimensional vectors. [ 65 ] Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features. It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data. [ 66 ] Feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process. However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded attempts to algorithmically define specific features. An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination, without relying on explicit algorithms. Sparse dictionary learning [ edit ] Main article: Sparse dictionary learning Sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and assumed to be a sparse matrix . The method is strongly NP-hard and difficult to solve approximately. [ 67 ] A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the k -SVD algorithm. Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs. For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de-noising . The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot. [ 68 ] Anomaly detection [ edit ] Main article: Anomaly detection In data mining , anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data. [ 69 ] Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud , a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are referred to as outliers , novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions. [ 70 ] In particular, in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection, the interesting objects are often not rare objects, but unexpected bursts of inactivity. This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object. Many outlier detection methods (in particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data unless aggregated appropriately. Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns. [ 71 ] Three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist. [ 72 ] Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabelled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit the least to the remainder of the data set. Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labelled as \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" and involves training a classifier (the key difference from many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection). Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behaviour from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model. Robot learning [ edit ] Robot learning is inspired by a multitude of machine learning methods, starting from supervised learning, reinforcement learning, [ 73 ] [ 74 ] and finally meta-learning (e.g. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

Association rules [ edit ] Main article: Association rule learning See also: Inductive logic programming Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of \"interestingness\". [ 75 ] Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves \"rules\" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilisation of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction. [ 76 ] Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems , association rule learning, and artificial immune systems . Based on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal , Tomasz Imieliński and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets. [ 77 ] For example, the rule { o n i o n s , p o t a t o e s } ⇒ { b u r g e r } {\\displaystyle \\{\\mathrm {onions,potatoes} \\}\\Rightarrow \\{\\mathrm {burger} \\}} found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements . In addition to market basket analysis , association rules are employed today in application areas including Web usage mining , intrusion detection , continuous production , and bioinformatics . In contrast with sequence mining , association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions. Learning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a genetic algorithm , with a learning component, performing either supervised learning , reinforcement learning , or unsupervised learning . They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions. [ 78 ] Inductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples. Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs . Inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing . Gordon Plotkin and Ehud Shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting. [ 79 ] [ 80 ] [ 81 ] Shapiro built their first implementation (Model Inference System) in 1981: a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples. [ 82 ] The term inductive here refers to philosophical induction, suggesting a theory to explain observed facts, rather than mathematical induction , proving a property for all members of a well-ordered set.", "strategy": "semantic"}

The application of ML to business problems is known as predictive analytics . Statistics and mathematical optimisation (mathematical programming) methods comprise the foundations of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) via unsupervised learning . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] From a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct learning provides a framework for describing machine learning. History [ edit ] See also: Timeline of machine learning The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel , an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The synonym self-teaching computers was also used in this time period. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The earliest machine learning program was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a computer program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, but the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes. [ 10 ] In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior , in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells . [ 11 ] Hebb's model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data. [ 10 ] Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch , who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes. [ 10 ] By the early 1960s, an experimental \"learning machine\" with punched tape memory, called Cybertron, had been developed by Raytheon Company to analyse sonar signals, electrocardiograms , and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning . It was repetitively \"trained\" by a human operator/teacher to recognise patterns and equipped with a \" goof \" button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions. [ 12 ] A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification. [ 13 ] Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973. [ 14 ] In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognise 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal. [ 15 ] Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T , as measured by P , improves with experience E .\" [ 16 ] This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing 's proposal in his paper \" Computing Machinery and Intelligence \", in which the question \"Can machines think?\" is replaced with the question \"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\". [ 17 ] Modern day Machine Learning algorithms are broken into 3 algorithms types: Supervised Learning Algorithms, Unsupervised Learning Algorithms, and Reinforcement Learning Algorithms. [ 18 ] Current Supervised Learning Algorithms have objectives of classification and regression. Current Unsupervised Learning Algorithms have objectives of clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association rule. Current Reinforcement Learning Algorithms focus on decisions that must be made with respect to some previous, unkown time and are broken down to either be studies of model based methods, and model free methods.

[ 20 ] Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis . [ 21 ] : 488 However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.

A system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression (by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution). Conversely, an optimal compressor can be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that compresses best, given the previous history). This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for \"general intelligence\". [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] An alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit feature space vectors , and compression-based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces.

An exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space; instead, feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods, LZW, LZ77, and PPM. [ 26 ] According to AIXI theory, a connection more directly explained in Hutter Prize , the best possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x. For example, in that model, a zip file's compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software, since you can not unzip it without both, but there may be an even smaller combined form. Examples of AI-powered audio/video compression software include NVIDIA Maxine , AIVC. [ 27 ] Examples of software that can perform AI-powered image compression include OpenCV , TensorFlow , MATLAB 's Image Processing Toolbox (IPT) and High-Fidelity Generative Image Compression. [ 28 ] In unsupervised machine learning , k-means clustering can be utilized to compress data by grouping similar data points into clusters. This technique simplifies handling extensive datasets that lack predefined labels and finds widespread use in fields such as image compression . [ 29 ] Data compression aims to reduce the size of data files, enhancing storage efficiency and speeding up data transmission. K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, is employed to partition a dataset into a specified number of clusters, k, each represented by the centroid of its points. This process condenses extensive datasets into a more compact set of representative points. Particularly beneficial in image and signal processing , k-means clustering aids in data reduction by replacing groups of data points with their centroids, thereby preserving the core information of the original data while significantly decreasing the required storage space. [ 30 ] Large language models (LLMs) are also efficient lossless data compressors on some data sets, as demonstrated by DeepMind 's research with the Chinchilla 70B model. Developed by DeepMind, Chinchilla 70B effectively compressed data, outperforming conventional methods such as Portable Network Graphics (PNG) for images and Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) for audio. It achieved compression of image and audio data to 43.4% and 16.4% of their original sizes, respectively. There is, however, some reason to be concerned that the data set used for testing overlaps the LLM training data set, making it possible that the Chinchilla 70B model is only an efficient compression tool on data it has already been trained on. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] Data mining [ edit ] Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as \" unsupervised learning \" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data. Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimisation : Many learning problems are formulated as minimisation of some loss function on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples). [ 33 ] Generalization [ edit ] Characterizing the generalisation of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research, especially for deep learning algorithms. Statistics [ edit ] Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population inferences from a sample , while machine learning finds generalisable predictive patterns. [ 34 ] Conventional statistical analyses require the a priori selection of a model most suitable for the study data set. In addition, only significant or theoretically relevant variables based on previous experience are included for analysis. In contrast, machine learning is not built on a pre-structured model; rather, the data shape the model by detecting underlying patterns. The more variables (input) used to train the model, the more accurate the ultimate model will be. [ 35 ] Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modelling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model, [ 36 ] wherein \"algorithmic model\" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random Forest . Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning . [ 37 ] Statistical physics [ edit ] Analytical and computational techniques derived from deep-rooted physics of disordered systems can be extended to large-scale problems, including machine learning, e.g., to analyse the weight space of deep neural networks . [ 38 ] Statistical physics is thus finding applications in the area of medical diagnostics . [ 39 ] Theory [ edit ] Main articles: Computational learning theory and Statistical learning theory A core objective of a learner is to generalise from its experience. [ 3 ] [ 40 ] Generalisation in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases. The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory via the probably approximately correct learning model. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The bias–variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalisation error . For the best performance in the context of generalisation, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalisation will be poorer. [ 41 ] In addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time . There are two kinds of time complexity results: Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time. Approaches [ edit ] In supervised learning , the training data is labelled with the expected answers, while in unsupervised learning , the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data. Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, which correspond to learning paradigms, depending on the nature of the \"signal\" or \"feedback\" available to the learning system: Supervised learning : The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a \"teacher\", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. Unsupervised learning : No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end ( feature learning ). Reinforcement learning : A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximise. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] Supervised learning [ edit ] Main article: Supervised learning A support-vector machine is a supervised learning model that divides the data into regions separated by a linear boundary . Here, the linear boundary divides the black circles from the white. Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs. [ 45 ] The data, known as training data , consists of a set of training examples. Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output, also known as a supervisory signal. In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an array or vector, sometimes called a feature vector , and the training data is represented by a matrix . Through iterative optimisation of an objective function , supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs. [ 46 ] An optimal function allows the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data. An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task. [ 16 ] Types of supervised-learning algorithms include active learning , classification and regression . [ 47 ] Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, while regression algorithms are used when the outputs can take any numerical value within a range. For example, in a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input is an incoming email, and the output is the folder in which to file the email. In contrast, regression is used for tasks such as predicting a person's height based on factors like age and genetics or forecasting future temperatures based on historical data. [ 48 ] Similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are. It has applications in ranking , recommendation systems , visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification. Unsupervised learning [ edit ] Main article: Unsupervised learning See also: Cluster analysis Unsupervised learning algorithms find structures in data that has not been labelled, classified or categorised. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data. Central applications of unsupervised machine learning include clustering, dimensionality reduction , [ 5 ] and density estimation . [ 49 ] Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters ) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated, for example, by internal compactness , or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and separation , the difference between clusters. Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity . A special type of unsupervised learning called, self-supervised learning involves training a model by generating the supervisory signal from the data itself. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] Semi-supervised learning [ edit ] Main article: Semi-supervised learning Semi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning (without any labelled training data) and supervised learning (with completely labelled training data). Some of the training examples are missing training labels, yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabelled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labelled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy. In weakly supervised learning , the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets. [ 52 ] Reinforcement learning [ edit ] Main article: Reinforcement learning Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximise some notion of cumulative reward. Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory , control theory , operations research , information theory , simulation-based optimisation , multi-agent systems , swarm intelligence , statistics and genetic algorithms . In reinforcement learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov decision process (MDP). Many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques. [ 53 ] Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and are used when exact models are infeasible. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

Dimensionality reduction [ edit ] Dimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. [ 54 ] In other words, it is a process of reducing the dimension of the feature set, also called the \"number of features\". Most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or extraction . One of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis (PCA). PCA involves changing higher-dimensional data (e.g., 3D) to a smaller space (e.g., 2D). The manifold hypothesis proposes that high-dimensional data sets lie along low-dimensional manifolds , and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption, leading to the area of manifold learning and manifold regularisation . Other types [ edit ] Other approaches have been developed which do not fit neatly into this three-fold categorisation, and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system.

[ 56 ] [ 57 ] It gives a solution to the problem learning without any external reward, by introducing emotion as an internal reward. Emotion is used as state evaluation of a self-learning agent. The CAA self-learning algorithm computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence situations. The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion. [ 58 ] The self-learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W =||w(a,s)|| such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine: in situation s perform action a receive a consequence situation s ' compute emotion of being in the consequence situation v(s') update crossbar memory w'(a,s) = w(a,s) + v(s') It is a system with only one input, situation, and only one output, action (or behaviour) a. There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment. The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation. The CAA exists in two environments, one is the behavioural environment where it behaves, and the other is the genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioural environment.

Feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions. This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution. This replaces manual feature engineering , and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task. Feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised. In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labelled input data. Examples include artificial neural networks , multilayer perceptrons , and supervised dictionary learning . In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabelled input data. Examples include dictionary learning, independent component analysis , autoencoders , matrix factorisation [ 61 ] and various forms of clustering . [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ] Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional. Sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse, meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros. Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into higher-dimensional vectors. [ 65 ] Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features. It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data. [ 66 ] Feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process. However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded attempts to algorithmically define specific features. An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination, without relying on explicit algorithms. Sparse dictionary learning [ edit ] Main article: Sparse dictionary learning Sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and assumed to be a sparse matrix . The method is strongly NP-hard and difficult to solve approximately. [ 67 ] A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the k -SVD algorithm. Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs. For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de-noising . The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot. [ 68 ] Anomaly detection [ edit ] Main article: Anomaly detection In data mining , anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data. [ 69 ] Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud , a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are referred to as outliers , novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions. [ 70 ] In particular, in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection, the interesting objects are often not rare objects, but unexpected bursts of inactivity. This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object. Many outlier detection methods (in particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data unless aggregated appropriately. Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns. [ 71 ] Three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist. [ 72 ] Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabelled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit the least to the remainder of the data set. Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labelled as \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" and involves training a classifier (the key difference from many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection). Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behaviour from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model. Robot learning [ edit ] Robot learning is inspired by a multitude of machine learning methods, starting from supervised learning, reinforcement learning, [ 73 ] [ 74 ] and finally meta-learning (e.g. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

Association rules [ edit ] Main article: Association rule learning See also: Inductive logic programming Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of \"interestingness\". [ 75 ] Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves \"rules\" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilisation of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction. [ 76 ] Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems , association rule learning, and artificial immune systems . Based on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal , Tomasz Imieliński and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets. [ 77 ] For example, the rule { o n i o n s , p o t a t o e s } ⇒ { b u r g e r } {\\displaystyle \\{\\mathrm {onions,potatoes} \\}\\Rightarrow \\{\\mathrm {burger} \\}} found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements . In addition to market basket analysis , association rules are employed today in application areas including Web usage mining , intrusion detection , continuous production , and bioinformatics . In contrast with sequence mining , association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions. Learning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a genetic algorithm , with a learning component, performing either supervised learning , reinforcement learning , or unsupervised learning . They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions. [ 78 ] Inductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples. Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs . Inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing . Gordon Plotkin and Ehud Shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting. [ 79 ] [ 80 ] [ 81 ] Shapiro built their first implementation (Model Inference System) in 1981: a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples. [ 82 ] The term inductive here refers to philosophical induction, suggesting a theory to explain observed facts, rather than mathematical induction , proving a property for all members of a well-ordered set.", "strategy": "semantic"}

The application of ML to business problems is known as predictive analytics . Statistics and mathematical optimisation (mathematical programming) methods comprise the foundations of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) via unsupervised learning . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] From a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct learning provides a framework for describing machine learning. History [ edit ] See also: Timeline of machine learning The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel , an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The synonym self-teaching computers was also used in this time period. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The earliest machine learning program was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a computer program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, but the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes. [ 10 ] In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior , in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells . [ 11 ] Hebb's model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data. [ 10 ] Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch , who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes. [ 10 ] By the early 1960s, an experimental \"learning machine\" with punched tape memory, called Cybertron, had been developed by Raytheon Company to analyse sonar signals, electrocardiograms , and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning . It was repetitively \"trained\" by a human operator/teacher to recognise patterns and equipped with a \" goof \" button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions. [ 12 ] A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification. [ 13 ] Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973. [ 14 ] In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognise 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal. [ 15 ] Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T , as measured by P , improves with experience E .\" [ 16 ] This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing 's proposal in his paper \" Computing Machinery and Intelligence \", in which the question \"Can machines think?\" is replaced with the question \"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\". [ 17 ] Modern day Machine Learning algorithms are broken into 3 algorithms types: Supervised Learning Algorithms, Unsupervised Learning Algorithms, and Reinforcement Learning Algorithms. [ 18 ] Current Supervised Learning Algorithms have objectives of classification and regression. Current Unsupervised Learning Algorithms have objectives of clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association rule. Current Reinforcement Learning Algorithms focus on decisions that must be made with respect to some previous, unkown time and are broken down to either be studies of model based methods, and model free methods.

[ 20 ] Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis .

Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.

A system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression (by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution). Conversely, an optimal compressor can be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that compresses best, given the previous history). This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for \"general intelligence\".

An exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space; instead, feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods, LZW, LZ77, and PPM. [ 26 ] According to AIXI theory, a connection more directly explained in Hutter Prize , the best possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x. For example, in that model, a zip file's compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software, since you can not unzip it without both, but there may be an even smaller combined form. Examples of AI-powered audio/video compression software include NVIDIA Maxine , AIVC. [ 27 ] Examples of software that can perform AI-powered image compression include OpenCV , TensorFlow , MATLAB 's Image Processing Toolbox (IPT) and High-Fidelity Generative Image Compression. [ 28 ] In unsupervised machine learning , k-means clustering can be utilized to compress data by grouping similar data points into clusters. This technique simplifies handling extensive datasets that lack predefined labels and finds widespread use in fields such as image compression . [ 29 ] Data compression aims to reduce the size of data files, enhancing storage efficiency and speeding up data transmission. K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, is employed to partition a dataset into a specified number of clusters, k, each represented by the centroid of its points. This process condenses extensive datasets into a more compact set of representative points. Particularly beneficial in image and signal processing , k-means clustering aids in data reduction by replacing groups of data points with their centroids, thereby preserving the core information of the original data while significantly decreasing the required storage space. [ 30 ] Large language models (LLMs) are also efficient lossless data compressors on some data sets, as demonstrated by DeepMind 's research with the Chinchilla 70B model. Developed by DeepMind, Chinchilla 70B effectively compressed data, outperforming conventional methods such as Portable Network Graphics (PNG) for images and Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) for audio. It achieved compression of image and audio data to 43.4% and 16.4% of their original sizes, respectively. There is, however, some reason to be concerned that the data set used for testing overlaps the LLM training data set, making it possible that the Chinchilla 70B model is only an efficient compression tool on data it has already been trained on. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] Data mining [ edit ] Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as \" unsupervised learning \" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data. Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimisation : Many learning problems are formulated as minimisation of some loss function on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples). [ 33 ] Generalization [ edit ] Characterizing the generalisation of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research, especially for deep learning algorithms. Statistics [ edit ] Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population inferences from a sample , while machine learning finds generalisable predictive patterns. [ 34 ] Conventional statistical analyses require the a priori selection of a model most suitable for the study data set. In addition, only significant or theoretically relevant variables based on previous experience are included for analysis. In contrast, machine learning is not built on a pre-structured model; rather, the data shape the model by detecting underlying patterns. The more variables (input) used to train the model, the more accurate the ultimate model will be. [ 35 ] Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modelling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model, [ 36 ] wherein \"algorithmic model\" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random Forest . Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning . [ 37 ] Statistical physics [ edit ] Analytical and computational techniques derived from deep-rooted physics of disordered systems can be extended to large-scale problems, including machine learning, e.g., to analyse the weight space of deep neural networks . [ 38 ] Statistical physics is thus finding applications in the area of medical diagnostics . [ 39 ] Theory [ edit ] Main articles: Computational learning theory and Statistical learning theory A core objective of a learner is to generalise from its experience. [ 3 ] [ 40 ] Generalisation in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases. The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory via the probably approximately correct learning model. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The bias–variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalisation error . For the best performance in the context of generalisation, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalisation will be poorer. [ 41 ] In addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time . There are two kinds of time complexity results: Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time. Approaches [ edit ] In supervised learning , the training data is labelled with the expected answers, while in unsupervised learning , the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data. Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, which correspond to learning paradigms, depending on the nature of the \"signal\" or \"feedback\" available to the learning system: Supervised learning : The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a \"teacher\", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. Unsupervised learning : No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end ( feature learning ). Reinforcement learning : A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximise. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

[ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] Supervised learning [ edit ] Main article: Supervised learning A support-vector machine is a supervised learning model that divides the data into regions separated by a linear boundary . Here, the linear boundary divides the black circles from the white. Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs. [ 45 ] The data, known as training data , consists of a set of training examples. Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output, also known as a supervisory signal. In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an array or vector, sometimes called a feature vector , and the training data is represented by a matrix . Through iterative optimisation of an objective function , supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs. [ 46 ] An optimal function allows the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data. An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task. [ 16 ] Types of supervised-learning algorithms include active learning , classification and regression . [ 47 ] Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, while regression algorithms are used when the outputs can take any numerical value within a range. For example, in a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input is an incoming email, and the output is the folder in which to file the email. In contrast, regression is used for tasks such as predicting a person's height based on factors like age and genetics or forecasting future temperatures based on historical data. [ 48 ] Similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are. It has applications in ranking , recommendation systems , visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification. Unsupervised learning [ edit ] Main article: Unsupervised learning See also: Cluster analysis Unsupervised learning algorithms find structures in data that has not been labelled, classified or categorised. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data. Central applications of unsupervised machine learning include clustering, dimensionality reduction , [ 5 ] and density estimation . [ 49 ] Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters ) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated, for example, by internal compactness , or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and separation , the difference between clusters. Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity . A special type of unsupervised learning called, self-supervised learning involves training a model by generating the supervisory signal from the data itself. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] Semi-supervised learning [ edit ] Main article: Semi-supervised learning Semi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning (without any labelled training data) and supervised learning (with completely labelled training data). Some of the training examples are missing training labels, yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabelled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labelled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy. In weakly supervised learning , the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets. [ 52 ] Reinforcement learning [ edit ] Main article: Reinforcement learning Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximise some notion of cumulative reward. Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory , control theory , operations research , information theory , simulation-based optimisation , multi-agent systems , swarm intelligence , statistics and genetic algorithms . In reinforcement learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov decision process (MDP). Many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques. [ 53 ] Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and are used when exact models are infeasible. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

Dimensionality reduction [ edit ] Dimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. [ 54 ] In other words, it is a process of reducing the dimension of the feature set, also called the \"number of features\". Most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or extraction . One of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis (PCA). PCA involves changing higher-dimensional data (e.g., 3D) to a smaller space (e.g., 2D). The manifold hypothesis proposes that high-dimensional data sets lie along low-dimensional manifolds , and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption, leading to the area of manifold learning and manifold regularisation . Other types [ edit ] Other approaches have been developed which do not fit neatly into this three-fold categorisation, and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system.

[ 55 ] Self-learning [ edit ] Self-learning, as a machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-learning, named crossbar adaptive array (CAA). [ 56 ] [ 57 ] It gives a solution to the problem learning without any external reward, by introducing emotion as an internal reward. Emotion is used as state evaluation of a self-learning agent. The CAA self-learning algorithm computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence situations. The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion. [ 58 ] The self-learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W =||w(a,s)|| such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine: in situation s perform action a receive a consequence situation s ' compute emotion of being in the consequence situation v(s') update crossbar memory w'(a,s) = w(a,s) + v(s') It is a system with only one input, situation, and only one output, action (or behaviour) a. There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment. The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation. The CAA exists in two environments, one is the behavioural environment where it behaves, and the other is the genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioural environment.

Feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions. This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution. This replaces manual feature engineering , and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task. Feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised. In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labelled input data. Examples include artificial neural networks , multilayer perceptrons , and supervised dictionary learning . In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabelled input data. Examples include dictionary learning, independent component analysis , autoencoders , matrix factorisation [ 61 ] and various forms of clustering . [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ] Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional. Sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse, meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros. Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into higher-dimensional vectors. [ 65 ] Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features. It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data. [ 66 ] Feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process. However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded attempts to algorithmically define specific features. An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination, without relying on explicit algorithms. Sparse dictionary learning [ edit ] Main article: Sparse dictionary learning Sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and assumed to be a sparse matrix . The method is strongly NP-hard and difficult to solve approximately. [ 67 ] A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the k -SVD algorithm. Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs. For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de-noising . The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot. [ 68 ] Anomaly detection [ edit ] Main article: Anomaly detection In data mining , anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data. [ 69 ] Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud , a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are referred to as outliers , novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions. [ 70 ] In particular, in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection, the interesting objects are often not rare objects, but unexpected bursts of inactivity. This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object. Many outlier detection methods (in particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data unless aggregated appropriately. Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns. [ 71 ] Three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist. [ 72 ] Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabelled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit the least to the remainder of the data set. Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labelled as \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" and involves training a classifier (the key difference from many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection). Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behaviour from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model. Robot learning [ edit ] Robot learning is inspired by a multitude of machine learning methods, starting from supervised learning, reinforcement learning, [ 73 ] [ 74 ] and finally meta-learning (e.g. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

Association rules [ edit ] Main article: Association rule learning See also: Inductive logic programming Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of \"interestingness\". [ 75 ] Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves \"rules\" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilisation of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction. [ 76 ] Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems , association rule learning, and artificial immune systems . Based on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal , Tomasz Imieliński and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets. [ 77 ] For example, the rule { o n i o n s , p o t a t o e s } ⇒ { b u r g e r } {\\displaystyle \\{\\mathrm {onions,potatoes} \\}\\Rightarrow \\{\\mathrm {burger} \\}} found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements . In addition to market basket analysis , association rules are employed today in application areas including Web usage mining , intrusion detection , continuous production , and bioinformatics . In contrast with sequence mining , association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions. Learning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a genetic algorithm , with a learning component, performing either supervised learning , reinforcement learning , or unsupervised learning . They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions. [ 78 ] Inductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples. Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs . Inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing . Gordon Plotkin and Ehud Shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting. [ 79 ] [ 80 ] [ 81 ] Shapiro built their first implementation (Model Inference System) in 1981: a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples. [ 82 ] The term inductive here refers to philosophical induction, suggesting a theory to explain observed facts, rather than mathematical induction , proving a property for all members of a well-ordered set.", "strategy": "semantic"}

Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs. For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de-noising . The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot.

NASA missions have found lots of evidence that Mars was much wetter and warmer, with a thicker atmosphere, billions of years ago. Mars was named by the Romans for their god of war because its reddish color was reminiscent of blood. The Egyptians called it \"Her Desher,\" meaning \"the red one.\" Even today, it is frequently called the \"Red Planet\" because iron minerals in the Martian dirt oxidize, or rust, causing the surface to look red. Namesake Mars was named by the ancient Romans for their god of war because its reddish color was reminiscent of blood. Other civilizations also named the planet for this attribute – for example, the Egyptians called it \"Her Desher,\" meaning \"the red one.\" Even today, it is frequently called the \"Red Planet\" because iron minerals in the Martian dirt oxidize, or rust, causing the surface to look red. Potential for Life Scientists don't expect to find living things currently thriving on Mars. Instead, they're looking for signs of life that existed long ago, when Mars was warmer and covered with water. Size and Distance With a radius of 2,106 miles (3,390 kilometers), Mars is about half the size of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mars would be about as big as a raspberry. From an average distance of 142 million miles (228 million kilometers), Mars is 1.5 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 13 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mars. Orbit and Rotation As Mars orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 24.6 hours, which is very similar to one day on Earth (23.9 hours). Martian days are called sols – short for \"solar day.\" A year on Mars lasts 669.6 sols, which is the same as 687 Earth days. Mars' axis of rotation is tilted 25 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun. This is another similarity with Earth, which has an axial tilt of 23.4 degrees. Like Earth, Mars has distinct seasons, but they last longer than seasons here on Earth since Mars takes longer to orbit the Sun (because it's farther away). And while here on Earth the seasons are evenly spread over the year, lasting 3 months (or one quarter of a year), on Mars the seasons vary in length because of Mars' elliptical, egg-shaped orbit around the Sun. Spring in the northern hemisphere (autumn in the southern) is the longest season at 194 sols. Autumn in the northern hemisphere (spring in the southern) is the shortest at 142 days. Northern winter/southern summer is 154 sols, and northern summer/southern winter is 178 sols. Moons Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos , that may be captured asteroids.

Explore the Moons of Mars › Rings Mars has no rings. However, in 50 million years when Phobos crashes into Mars or breaks apart, it could create a dusty ring around the Red Planet. Formation When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5 billion years ago, Mars formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become the fourth planet from the Sun. Mars is about half the size of Earth, and like its fellow terrestrial planets, it has a central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust. Structure Mars has a dense core at its center between 930 and 1,300 miles (1,500 to 2,100 kilometers) in radius. It's made of iron, nickel, and sulfur. Surrounding the core is a rocky mantle between 770 and 1,170 miles (1,240 to 1,880 kilometers) thick, and above that, a crust made of iron, magnesium, aluminum, calcium, and potassium. This crust is between 6 and 30 miles (10 to 50 kilometers) deep. Surface The Red Planet is actually many colors. At the surface, we see colors such as brown, gold, and tan. The reason Mars looks reddish is due to oxidization – or rusting – of iron in the rocks, regolith (Martian “soil”), and dust of Mars. This dust gets kicked up into the atmosphere and from a distance makes the planet appear mostly red. Interestingly, while Mars is about half the diameter of Earth, its surface has nearly the same area as Earth’s dry land. Its volcanoes, impact craters, crustal movement, and atmospheric conditions such as dust storms have altered the landscape of Mars over many years, creating some of the solar system's most interesting topographical features. A Very Large Canyon A large canyon system called Valles Marineris is long enough to stretch from California to New York – more than 3,000 miles (4,800 kilometers). This Martian canyon is 200 miles (320 kilometers) at its widest and 4.3 miles (7 kilometers) at its deepest. That's about 10 times the size of Earth's Grand Canyon . The Largest Volcano Mars is home to the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons . It's three times taller than Earth's Mount Everest — which rises 29,029 feet, or 8,848 meters, above the Earth's surface — with a base the size of the state of New Mexico. Olympus Mons stands Water on Mars Mars appears to have had a watery past, with ancient river valley networks, deltas, and lakebeds, as well as rocks and minerals on the surface that could only have formed in liquid water. Some features suggest that Mars experienced huge floods about 3.5 billion years ago. There is water on Mars today, but the Martian atmosphere is too thin for liquid water to exist for long on the surface. Today, water on Mars is found in the form of water-ice just under the surface in the polar regions as well as in briny (salty) water, which seasonally flows down some hillsides and crater walls. Atmosphere Mars has a thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon gases. To our eyes, the sky would be hazy and red because of suspended dust instead of the familiar blue tint we see on Earth. Mars' sparse atmosphere doesn't offer much protection from impacts by such objects as meteorites, asteroids, and comets. The temperature on Mars can be as high as 70 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) or as low as about -225 degrees Fahrenheit (-153 degrees Celsius). And because the atmosphere is so thin, heat from the Sun easily escapes this planet. If you were to stand on the surface of Mars on the equator at noon, it would feel like spring at your feet (75 degrees Fahrenheit or 24 degrees Celsius) and winter at your head (32 degrees Fahrenheit or 0 degrees Celsius). Occasionally, winds on Mars are strong enough to create dust storms that cover much of the planet. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

Phobos, the larger of Mars' two moons, is seen in this image taken by NASA's High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter . NASA/JPL-Caltech/University of Arizona Phobos, the innermost and larger moon, is heavily cratered, with deep grooves on its surface. It is slowly moving towards Mars and will crash into the planet or break apart in about 50 million years. Deimos is about half as big as Phobos and orbits two and a half times farther away from Mars. Oddly-shaped Deimos is covered in loose dirt that often fills the craters on its surface, making it appear smoother than pockmarked Phobos. This enhanced-color image of Deimos, the smaller of the two moons of Mars, was taken on Feb. 21, 2009.

Explore the Moons of Mars › Rings Mars has no rings. However, in 50 million years when Phobos crashes into Mars or breaks apart, it could create a dusty ring around the Red Planet. Formation When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5 billion years ago, Mars formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become the fourth planet from the Sun. Mars is about half the size of Earth, and like its fellow terrestrial planets, it has a central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust. Structure Mars has a dense core at its center between 930 and 1,300 miles (1,500 to 2,100 kilometers) in radius. It's made of iron, nickel, and sulfur. Surrounding the core is a rocky mantle between 770 and 1,170 miles (1,240 to 1,880 kilometers) thick, and above that, a crust made of iron, magnesium, aluminum, calcium, and potassium. This crust is between 6 and 30 miles (10 to 50 kilometers) deep. Surface The Red Planet is actually many colors. At the surface, we see colors such as brown, gold, and tan. The reason Mars looks reddish is due to oxidization – or rusting – of iron in the rocks, regolith (Martian “soil”), and dust of Mars. This dust gets kicked up into the atmosphere and from a distance makes the planet appear mostly red. Interestingly, while Mars is about half the diameter of Earth, its surface has nearly the same area as Earth’s dry land. Its volcanoes, impact craters, crustal movement, and atmospheric conditions such as dust storms have altered the landscape of Mars over many years, creating some of the solar system's most interesting topographical features. A Very Large Canyon A large canyon system called Valles Marineris is long enough to stretch from California to New York – more than 3,000 miles (4,800 kilometers). This Martian canyon is 200 miles (320 kilometers) at its widest and 4.3 miles (7 kilometers) at its deepest. That's about 10 times the size of Earth's Grand Canyon . The Largest Volcano Mars is home to the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons . It's three times taller than Earth's Mount Everest — which rises 29,029 feet, or 8,848 meters, above the Earth's surface — with a base the size of the state of New Mexico. Olympus Mons stands Water on Mars Mars appears to have had a watery past, with ancient river valley networks, deltas, and lakebeds, as well as rocks and minerals on the surface that could only have formed in liquid water. Some features suggest that Mars experienced huge floods about 3.5 billion years ago. There is water on Mars today, but the Martian atmosphere is too thin for liquid water to exist for long on the surface. Today, water on Mars is found in the form of water-ice just under the surface in the polar regions as well as in briny (salty) water, which seasonally flows down some hillsides and crater walls. Atmosphere Mars has a thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon gases. To our eyes, the sky would be hazy and red because of suspended dust instead of the familiar blue tint we see on Earth. Mars' sparse atmosphere doesn't offer much protection from impacts by such objects as meteorites, asteroids, and comets. The temperature on Mars can be as high as 70 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) or as low as about -225 degrees Fahrenheit (-153 degrees Celsius). And because the atmosphere is so thin, heat from the Sun easily escapes this planet. If you were to stand on the surface of Mars on the equator at noon, it would feel like spring at your feet (75 degrees Fahrenheit or 24 degrees Celsius) and winter at your head (32 degrees Fahrenheit or 0 degrees Celsius). Occasionally, winds on Mars are strong enough to create dust storms that cover much of the planet. ", "strategy": "semantic"}

A detailed overview on how to contribute can be found in the **[contributing guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/development/contributing.html)**. If you are simply looking to start working with the pandas codebase, navigate to the [GitHub \"issues\" tab](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues) and start looking through interesting issues. There are a number of issues listed under [Docs](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3ADocs%20sort%3Aupdated-desc) and [good first issue](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22%20sort%3Aupdated-desc) where you could start out. You can also triage issues which may include reproducing bug reports, or asking for vital information such as version numbers or reproduction instructions. If you would like to start triaging issues, one easy way to get started is to [subscribe to pandas on CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/pandas-dev/pandas). Or maybe through using pandas you have an idea of your own or are looking for something in the documentation and thinking ‘this can be improved’...you can do something about it!

It centralizes the model definition so that this definition is agreed upon across the ecosystem. `transformers` is the pivot across frameworks: if a model definition is supported, it will be compatible with the majority of training frameworks (Axolotl, Unsloth, DeepSpeed, FSDP, PyTorch-Lightning, ...), inference engines (vLLM, SGLang, TGI, ...), and adjacent modeling libraries (llama.cpp, mlx, ...) which leverage the model definition from `transformers`. We pledge to help support new state-of-the-art models and democratize their usage by having their model definition be simple, customizable, and efficient.

Lower compute costs, smaller carbon footprint: \\- Share trained models instead of training from scratch. \\- Reduce compute time and production costs. \\- Dozens of model architectures with 1M+ pretrained checkpoints across all modalities. 1\\. Choose the right framework for every part of a models lifetime: \\- Train state-of-the-art models in 3 lines of code. \\- Move a single model between PyTorch/JAX/TF2.0 frameworks at will. \\- Pick the right framework for training, evaluation, and production. 1\\. Easily customize a model or an example to your needs: \\- We provide examples for each architecture to reproduce the results published by its original authors. \\- Model internals are exposed as consistently as possible. \\- Model files can be used independently of the library for quick experiments. ![Hugging Face Enterprise Hub](https://github.com/user- attachments/assets/247fb16d-d251-4583-96c4-d3d76dda4925) ## Why shouldn't I use Transformers? \\- This library is not a modular toolbox of building blocks for neural nets. The code in the model files is not refactored with additional abstractions on purpose, so that researchers can quickly iterate on each of the models without diving into additional abstractions/files. \\- The training API is optimized to work with PyTorch models provided by Transformers. For generic machine learning loops, you should use another library like [Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate). \\- The [example scripts](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples) are only *examples*. They may not necessarily work out-of-the-box on your specific use case and you'll need to adapt the code for it to work. ## 100 projects using Transformers Transformers is more than a toolkit to use pretrained models, it's a community of projects built around it and the Hugging Face Hub. We want Transformers to enable developers, researchers, students, professors, engineers, and anyone else to build their dream projects. In order to celebrate Transformers 100,000 stars, we wanted to put the spotlight on the community with the [awesome-transformers](./awesome-transformers.md) page which lists 100 incredible projects built with Transformers. If you own or use a project that you believe should be part of the list, please open a PR to add it! ", "strategy": "semantic"}
